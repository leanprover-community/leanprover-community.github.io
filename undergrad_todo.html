    <h1>Missing undergraduate mathematics in mathlib</h1>

    <p>
    This gives pointers to undergraduate maths topics that are
    currently missing in mathlib.
    The list is gathered from
    <a href="http://media.devenirenseignant.gouv.fr/file/agreg_externe/59/7/p2020_agreg_ext_maths_1107597.pdf">
    the French curriculum</a>.
    There is also a page listing undergraduate maths topics
    that are
    <a href="undergrad.html">already in mathlib</a>.
    </p>

    <p>If you want to work on an item from this list then
    you should first check the
    <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pulls">pull requests list</a>
    to see whether it is already coming, then the
    <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues">issues list</a>
    to see whether it is discussed there, and finally talk
    about this idea on <a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/">Zulip</a>.
    </p>

    <p>To update this list, please submit a PR modifying
    <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/edit/master/docs/undergrad.yaml">
