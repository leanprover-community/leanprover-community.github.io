  summary: >
    Interactive provers (or proof assistants) are tools used to verify the correctness of programs and the formalization of mathematics. Unlike tools such as model checkers and SAT solvers, proof assistants are highly interactive. Machine-checked formal proofs lead to reliable and mathematically sound programs. This course introduces students to the theory and use of proof assistants, using Lean. We will use Lean to verify properties of functional programs and mathematical theorems. We will learn the theory of deductive reasoning and the logic on which these tools are based. We adopted the The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Logical Verification book.

  summary: >
    This course covers the principles of algorithm design: divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, reduction, dynamic programming, exhaustive search, and more. These principles are presented using Lean, a purely functional language, which allows for simpler explanations and shorter programs than those typically obtained with imperative languages. In Lean, as in Haskell and other functional languages, algorithm development uses equational reasoning when applicable; the course clarifies the conditions under which it applies and the arguments for correctness.

  summary: >
    This is a first-year seminar to a self-selected class of 12 students, who are not necessarily intending to major in mathematics, with the following description: Over millennia, mathematicians have developed an increasingly precise system of logical reasoning which determines what counts as a valid proof of a mathematical statement. But pen-and-paper proofs can contain subtle mistakes that are hard to catch. This First-Year Seminar will provide a hands-on introduction to a new method of proof writing, where a logical argument is developed interactively with a computer tool called a computer proof assistant, which simultaneously checks the underlying logic. Through a series of games, we’ll explore the computer proof assistant Lean while learning how to state, interpret, and prove increasingly sophisticated theorems. The course will also discuss real-world applications of formal methods to verifying software and hardware as well as the effect this paradigm-shifting method of proof-writing is having on mathematical research.

  summary: Project-based course aimed at undergrads and early grad students. The focus of the class was purely on the practical aspect of using Lean to state and prove mathematical statements. The intended outcome was not a deep understanding of how Lean works but having the practical skills of breaking down the problem, debugging it, asking for help on Zulip in a productive way, etc. The students spend the first 3 weeks doing exercises in MiL, and the other 7 weeks doing a project.
  tags: ['English', 'mathematics', 'beginner']
  experiences: Students felt that the pace is too fast. No one completed more than 4-5 chapters of MiL. Projects mostly went well. Each team had two people -- a team leader, who proposed the project (grad student or student with previous Lean experience). This worked well in that the team leader moved the project forward but, on the other hand, the other team member struggled to keep up.

    at CMU in 2022.  Student did weekly homework implementing or completing the
    implementation for small example results, and they also produced a midterm
    and a final project where they implemented any mathematics result they
    chose.  Some example final projects were implementing the definitions and
    results of elementary group theory through Legrange’s Theorem and a proof
    of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.

    This worked very well for a month, with a lot of questions and my adapting explanations.
    Once the projects started the decoupling of lectures and evaluation led to a sharp drop in attendance.
    I course corrected and made lectures into project demo/help/live-coding.
    Advanced students explaining what they had done and less advanced explained what they had,
    where they were stuck, what they needed etc and I (and their fellow students) helped them get unstuck.
    This is working well. Next time I teach I will transition earlier and in a more planned way to this mode.

    This course is completely bilingual between English and Lean,

    It's the standard syllabus of a US "intro to proofs" course for first/second-year undergraduates,
    covering "proof techniques", good style in proof writing,
    elementary number theory, "sufficiently large", recurrence relations,
    functions, relations, and set operations.
    The textbook "The Mechanics of Proof" (link above) was written for this course.
  experiences: >
    The course has been taught since 2023 and is now on its fourth iteration.
    The students like using Lean and are able to learn it at the pace required.
    I invested a lot of energy in writing custom tactics which perform exactly one step of reasoning that I would permit on paper,
    and deliberately never mentioned several more powerful tactics.
    This is very useful if the course is explicitly supposed to teach good style in proof writing.

    Short module introducing proof to 1st year undergraduates using Lean3 - in French.
    We used proof-term style in Lean.
  experiences:
    - 1st time we use a proof assistant to teach maths
    - students globally appreciated it (feedback, autonomy, playful)
    - some of them think it helped them with maths
    - most of them found the Lean syntax difficult (they also tended to attribute their shortcomings in maths to a programming difficulties)
    - many of them found the Lean error messages helpless

    Since January 2019, I am using Lean to teach first year undergrad double major maths/CS students how to find and write mathematical proofs.
    I first did it alone and then with Frédéric Bourgeois and Christine Paulin.
    The main mathematical topic of this course is elementary real analysis, especially the theory of convergent sequences and continuous functions.
    Since 2021 I use a controlled natural language for input in order to facilitate transferring Lean proofs to pen and paper proofs.
  experiences: >
    This course really works well, and it will probably continue for a long time.
    The idea to use controlled natural language tactics seems a lot more efficient than the native syntax to ensure students improve at pen and paper proofs.

  summary: >
    A 1-semester course aimed at graduate students in algebra and related topics at Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt and Glasgow universities.
    Aimed to approach Lean as mathematicians and future formalisers, establishing proficiency in tactic mode.
    For the first part of the course we learned the basics of first-order logic in Lean using the tutorials project,
    before discussing some basics of types and type classes to talk about formalising algebra. Also made use of lftcm2020 exercise sheets, and MiL.
    Concluded with a hackathon working on some group projects.
  experiences: >
    We tried to avoid touching on too much type theory early on to get people confidently interacting with Lean quickly.
    In retrospect, it would have been good to cover this in more depth (albeit only later in the course, after establishing confidence interacting with Lean)
    to aid in dealing with the inevitable issues that arise when formalising an interesting piece of mathematics.
    Also, we originally aimed for the outcome of the course to be group projects working on mathlib contributions,
    but would now say that re-framing the goal as formalising something new in a format that is useful to you as a learner
    (e.g. as a worksheet/interactive part of a textbook) is a better goal pedagogically
    (and could still lead to, e.g., a mathlib contribution in the process even if that isn't the explicit goal).

    The goal is not to achieve Lean proficiency, but rather to bolster students' understanding of the traditional material.
  experiences: >
    Given the size of the course and the momentum of the large TA staff, a full Lean integration is a multi-year effort.
    Students' ability to translate between formal and informal statements was significantly improved over the year before.
    I leaned heavily on the terminology "context," "hypothesis," and "goal" (inspired by the Lean infoview) and there
    were clear signs that this structure was influencing students' approaches to informal proofs.

    optional for the students.
  experiences: >
    The course is still ongoing, so we still don't have evidence of success. We decided to use Lean3 instead of Lean4 because of the easyness to install
    the `trylean` bundle, but will reconsider this decision next year. Students seem to be uninterested and/or scared at the beginning, but as i had shown
    how to use it to prove some example exercises, some have shown more interest. We plan to do an introductory seminar for those that want to learn how to use it.

    while the other half was spent on a computer lab playing through several levels of a Lean game whose ultimate goal was to proof the plane separation theorem. This was the first
    experience for the students with both axiomatic mathematics and theorem provers. While the course was taught in Catalan, the game is written in English.
  experiences: >
    The students found the Lean part the most challenging part of the course. The students would happily seat through the traditional-style lecture, but struggled when they had to code in Lean the proofs that they had
    previously discussed. This is in part because of Lean's unforgiveness, but we believe it is also due to the fact that they were unaware of some misunderstandings about the proofs, and Lean made those emerge.

In the end, we looked at examples of how proof assistants and type theory can be used in computer science, mathematics and computational linguistics. We used only term mode proofs (with the exception of rw/calc).
  experiences: >
    I was surprised how far one can get with essentially term-mode-only proofs. Term mode makes it easier to devise a reasonable paper exam. Bringing the students from the three different subjects together was a challenge. We lost all pure computational linguists during the course of the semester. The students of mathematics seemed to enjoy the course, even though we had little mathematical content.

    (The course name is therefore a bit of a misnomer, chosen in order to avoid a few turf issues at Boston University.)
    The reference textbook is Heather Macbeth's "The Mechanics of Proof".
    Most of the enrolled students are majoring in computer science, with the remaining few majoring in mathematics or computer engineering.
    The course is intended to teach the rigor of mathematical proofs as well as various proof methods commonly encountered in the mathematical sciences.
    Students are assigned weekly homework exercises which they have to solve in one of two ways, or in both ways:
    (a) with Lean 4 and (b) in longhand "paper-and-pen" style.
    Lean 4 will also be used as a functional programming language, in particular, in homework exercises involving the implementation of standard algorithms and some of their variations on finite graphs.
