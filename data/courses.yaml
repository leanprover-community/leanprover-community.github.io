  summary: >
    The aim of the course is to learn some Lean 3 using easy mathemtics (such as divisibility, \sqrt 2 \notin \Q, and the 
    pigeonwhole principle). The course is in German and was taught in summer 2023 for one full semester with weekly homeworks. We met once a week, discussed upcoming topics and 
    started to work on the next exercises in class. The manuscript contains an extended cheat sheet for Lean tactics.
  experiences: >
    The course was intended for students in mathematics who want to become teachers, but was also taken by other math 
    students. Only using Prop-types in the first few lessons was a good idea, in my opinion. The students liked the interactive feeling even of the simple proofs. Weekly 
    homeworks were made quite consistently, the dropout-rate (among ~15 students) was low.

  summary: >
    This was an introduction to proving, programming and proving programs in Lean, and also the Dependent Type Theory foundations of Lean.
    The evaluation was based mainly on projects but also on labs.
  experiences: >
    My plan was to live code, then clean-up and add documentation and generate notes with DocGen4.
    This worked very well for a month, with a lot of questions and my adapting explanations.
    Once the projects started the decoupling of lectures and evaluation led to a sharp drop in attendance.
    I course corrected and made lectures into project demo/help/live-coding.
    Advanced students explaining what they had done and less advanced explained what they had,
    where they were stuck, what they needed etc and I (and their fellow students) helped them get unstuck.
    This is working well. Next time I teach I will transition earlier and in a more planned way to this mode.

  summary: >
    Masters course for computer science students with the first half of the term consisting of a hands-on introduction to Lean 4 and type theory
    and the second half consisting of the students working on either a semantics/compiler project or a formalisation of a graph theory problem.
  experiences: >
    This was already the second year we used Lean 4 and it was good to do it in person again after teaching exclusively online due to Covid the year before.
    We had different levels of learning speed among the students but in the end everybody go the point where they intuitively could use Lean.
    Some students were really eager to golf every proof.

  summary: >
    I have written this as a course which is completely bilingual between English and Lean,
    with every example presented both ways (students also have to solve every homework problem both ways).
    It's the standard syllabus of a US "intro to proofs" course for first/second-year undergraduates,
    covering "proof techniques", good style in proof writing,
    elementary number theory, "sufficiently large", recurrence relations,
    functions, relations, and set operations.
  experiences: >
    The students liked using Lean and were able to learn it at the pace required.
    I invested a lot of energy in writing custom tactics which perform exactly one step of reasoning that I would permit on paper,
    and deliberately never mentioned several more powerful tactics.
    This is very useful if the course is explicitly supposed to teach good style in proof writing.
    It lets you off the hook in grading -- you can just say "that's not enough detail -- Lean wouldn't accept it!"

    Short module introducing proof to 1st year undergraduates using Lean3 - in French.
    We used proof-term style in Lean.
  experiences:
    - 1st time we use a proof assistant to teach maths
    - students globally appreciated it (feedback, autonomy, playful)
    - some of them think it helped them with maths
    - most of them found the Lean syntax difficult (they also tended to attribute their shortcomings in maths to a programming difficulties)
    - many of them found the Lean error messages helpless

  summary: >
    Since January 2019, I am using Lean to teach first year undergrad double major maths/CS students how to find and write mathematical proofs.
    I first did it alone and then with Frédéric Bourgeois and Christine Paulin.
    The main mathematical topic of this course is elementary real analysis, especially the theory of convergent sequences and continuous functions.
    Since 2021 I use a controlled natural language for input in order to facilitate transferring Lean proofs to pen and paper proofs.
  experiences: >
    This course really works well, and it will probably continue for a long time.
    The idea to use controlled natural language tactics seems a lot more efficient than the native syntax to ensure students improve at pen and paper proofs.

  tags: algebra
  summary: >
    A 1-semester course aimed at graduate students in algebra and related topics at Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt and Glasgow universities.
    Aimed to approach Lean as mathematicians and future formalisers, establishing proficiency in tactic mode.
    For the first part of the course we learned the basics of first-order logic in Lean using the tutorials project,
    before discussing some basics of types and type classes to talk about formalising algebra. Also made use of lftcm2020 exercise sheets, and MiL.
    Concluded with a hackathon working on some group projects.
  experiences: >
    We tried to avoid touching on too much type theory early on to get people confidently interacting with Lean quickly.
    In retrospect, it would have been good to cover this in more depth (albeit only later in the course, after establishing confidence interacting with Lean)
    to aid in dealing with the inevitable issues that arise when formalising an interesting piece of mathematics.
    Also, we originally aimed for the outcome of the course to be group projects working on mathlib contributions,
    but would now say that re-framing the goal as formalising something new in a format that is useful to you as a learner
    (e.g. as a worksheet/interactive part of a textbook) is a better goal pedagogically
    (and could still lead to, e.g., a mathlib contribution in the process even if that isn't the explicit goal).

  summary: >
    This is an upper level undergraduate/graduate course that teaches the theory and practice of proof assistants using Lean.
    Topics covered include verification of functional programs, PL semantics, mathematical structures, metaprogramming,
    and logical foundations. The course is based on Jasmin Blanchette's course Logical Verification and uses the
    Hitchhiker's Guide to Logical Verification as a reference.
  experiences: >
    I have taught this course twice at Brown and it has proven to be quite popular, attracting a mixed audience
    of people interested in math/logic, PL research, and functional programming. Final projects have included a verified
    executable DPLL SAT solver; the mathlib tactic `linear_combination` and initial work toward `polyrith` explorations
    of axiomatic ZFC, linear algebra, and other mathematical topics; and more.

  tags: ['intro to proofs', 'number theory', 'combinatorics']
  summary: >
    This is a large introductory course that is taken by most computer science students at Brown.
    It teaches logic, combinatorics, number theory, and probability, focusing on concepts that are important in computer science.
    In spring 2023 we introduced a Lean component to the course, to emphasize the concepts of proof and deduction.
    The goal is not to achieve Lean proficiency, but rather to bolster students' understanding of the traditional material.
  experiences: >
    Given the size of the course and the momentum of the large TA staff, a full Lean integration is a multi-year effort.
    Students' ability to translate between formal and informal statements was significantly improved over the year before.
    I leaned heavily on the terminology "context," "hypothesis," and "goal" (inspired by the Lean infoview) and there
    were clear signs that this structure was influencing students' approaches to informal proofs.

    A graduate course in mathematical logic taken mostly by MA and PhD students in mathematics and offered every other year (Fall 2016+2n, n=0,1,2,3,4).
    Model theory, computability theory, set theory. In particular syntax and semantics of first order logic; incompleteness, completeness, and compactness theorems;
    Loewenheim-Skolem theorems; computable and computably enumerable sets; axioms of set theory; ordinals and cardinals.    
    Since 2020 I include Lean exercises and projects, and some discussion of type theory.
    For example, formalization of part of Gödel's theorems is included at https://github.com/bjoernkjoshanssen/math654/blob/main/g%C3%B6del-beta-homework.lean
  experiences: >
    The students are willing and able to learn Lean. Including Lean showcases logic as a vibrant rather than dormant area of study.
    As projects in 2022 students created formalizations of exercise solutions for my book "Automatic complexity",
    some of which are included at https://github.com/bjoernkjoshanssen/diophantine-lemma

    a mathematical proof in such a way that one can formally verify its correctness.
  experiences: >
    This 3-credit course ran for the first time in August 2023 and used Lean 4.
    Lecture time was spent live-coding together.
    The student population was upper-division math majors at Ohio State.
    Assessment was build around weekly problem sets, a midterm project, and a final project.

  tags: ['topology']
  summary: >
    It is a standard course on general topology in the Mathematics degree. It is taught in spanish, so the material in the repo uses spanish too.
    It is not a course about Lean: Lean is only used as a complement, to help students grab the steps of rigourous proofs.
  experiences: >
    The course is still ongoing, so we still don't have evidence of success. We decided to use Lean3 instead of Lean4 because of the easyness to install
    the `trylean` bundle, but will reconsider this decision next year.
