    The admin team oversees the activities of the Lean community organization and in particular the mathlib project. It is responsible for ensuring the mathlib project continues to reflect the general views and interests of the Lean/mathlib community.

    The admin team is a central hub for coordination among other teams. It is responsible for procedural duties: when a decision needs to be made, what should the process be? In particular it is tasked with finding procedures to resolve conflicts when consensus cannot be reached. The admin team also the first point of contact for the community as a whole.

    The members of all teams choose an admin team annually by an election, in a manner organized by the current admin team using a system that gives all members a vote of equal weight. Members of the admin team may be re-elected.

- name: Maintainer team
  short_description: The mathlib maintainers have the power to approve changes and additions to mathlib. This team is responsible for the global design of mathlib, and it aims to maintain the library's coherence and keep its parts well integrated.
  description: |
    The mathlib library is under active development, with hundreds of proposed changes and additions under discussion at any time, and dozens approved every week. These proposals are structured as ["pull requests" on the mathlib Github repository](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pulls). The mathlib maintainers are the people who have the power to give final approval to pull requests. They must ensure mathlib has a cohesive design with a high-quality implementation.

    Mathlib maintainers usually have research-level knowledge in some field of mathematics or computer science. Community members become maintainers at the invitation of the current maintainers, and anyone may nominate a community member by sending a message to a current maintainer. Maintainers serve for a renewable two-year term, with the expectation that the term will be renewed unless the maintainer has become inactive or wishes to step down.
