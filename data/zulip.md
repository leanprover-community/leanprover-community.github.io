## The Lean prover Zulip chat

The main gathering point of our community is a
[Zulip chat instance](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com).
You can browse public discussions on the most popular "streams" without registering.
There is also a web-indexed [archive](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/),
with a less convenient interface.

We welcome you to register for the Zulip chat,
which will let you participate in the discussions.
Registering with your real name is preferred, but not required.
Starting by briefly introducing youself in the
[*new members* stream](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members)
is also appreciated.

Questions from users at all levels of expertise are welcomed.
Asking your first questions in the new members stream will ensure the answers
won't asssume you know much about Lean. But you are welcome to use more specialized streams.
Please start new discussion topics rather than using unrelated existing topics.
If you need coding help, you may be asked to provide a "minimal working example"
([MWE](mwe.html)).
Also beware of [XY problems](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem): try to give enough context.

To post a snippet of code inline, enclose it in single backticks: `` `my code here` ``.
If your code contains backticks itself, enclose it in more backticks than it contains:
``` `` my`code`contains`backticks `` ```.

Longer snippets should be enclosed between two lines containing three back-quotes, as in:
````md
```
def my_nat : n := 5
#check my_nat
```
````

You can use LaTeX using `$$` to enclose inline LaTeX and
````md
```latex
my LaTeX code here
```
````

for displayed math.
