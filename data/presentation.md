## Lean and its Mathematical Library

The [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover.github.io)
is a proof assistant developed principally by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research.

The current stable version of Lean is Lean 3, and this website is mostly about Lean 3.
But the community is currently switching to Lean 4.

The Lean mathematical library, *mathlib*, is a community-driven effort
to build a unified library of mathematics formalized in the
Lean proof assistant. The library also contains definitions
useful for programming. This project is very active, with many
regular contributors and daily activity.

You can get a bird's-eye view of what is in the mathlib library by
reading [the library overview](mathlib-overview.html), and read about
recent additions on our [blog](/blog/).
The design and community organization of mathlib are
described in the 2020 article
[The Lean mathematical library](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09336), although
the library has grown by an order of magnitude since that article appeared.
You can also have a look at our [repository statistics](mathlib_stats.html)
to see how the library grows and who contributes to it.
