# Usage instructions:
# This list collects all the Mathlib documentation resources available on the Web.
# If you know useful resources that meet the criteria, please add it to the list!
# To check the criteria, answer for yourself if the resource is:
# * Focussed on Mathlib?
#   (As opposed to: it applies to any Lean project, or it only briefly mentions Mathlib.)
# * Up to date?
#   (As opposed to: it only works for Lean 3, and irrelevant for new Mathlib versions.)
# * Published by the Mathlib community?
#   (As opposed to: someone's blog post.)
# * Commonly recommended as a resource by the community?
#   (As opposed to: it only works for Lean 3.)
# If you have a few "yes" answers, your resource probably qualifies.
#
# We aim to follow the Divio (https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/) classification of documentation into four categories:
# * Tutorial for learning (for studying; practical steps).
#   Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind.
# * How-to for problem solving (for working; practical steps).
#   How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.
# * Reference for information (for working; theoretical knowledge).
#   Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.
# * Explanation for understanding (for studying; theoretical knowledge).
#   Explanations, or discussions, clarify and illuminate a particular topic.
