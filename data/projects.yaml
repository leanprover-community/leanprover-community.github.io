super:
  description: |
    Version one of a small superposition prover
    written in Lean. This repository introduces
    a tactic `super` which attempts to solve 
    problems in first order logic, possibly 
    given a list of extra hypotheses.

    This version is not compatible with community
    releases of Lean.

mathematica:
  description: |
    Connects Lean to the computer algebra system
    Mathematica. This project offers a 
    bi-directional translation between the two
    systems. From within Lean, you can evaluate
    Mathematica commands, possibly including
    translated Lean expressions, and process
    the results. From Mathematica, you can access
    a Lean environment.

    Examples of calling Mathematica from Lean
    can be found at 
    [robertylewis/mathematica_examples](https://github.com/robertylewis/mathematica_examples),
    and examples in the other direction at 
    [minchaowu/mm-lean](https://github.com/minchaowu/mm-lean).
    These repositories are not in the contrib list
    because they depend on Mathematica, which 
    is proprietary software.

lean-perfectoid-spaces: 
  description: |
    Perfectoid spaces are sophisticated objects in arithmetic geometry 
    introduced by Peter Scholze in 2012. We formalised enough definitions 
    and theorems in topology, algebra and geometry to define perfectoid 
    spaces in Lean. See also our
    [project webpage](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-perfectoid-spaces/)
    and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12320).
