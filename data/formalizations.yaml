  title: The cap-set problem
  authors: Dahmen, Hölzl and Lewis
  abstract: |
            In 2016, Ellenberg and Gijswijt established a new upper bound on
            the size of subsets of $𝔽^n_q$ with no three-term arithmetic
            progression. This problem has received much mathematical attention,
            particularly in the case $q = 3$, where it is commonly known as the
            cap set problem. Ellenberg and Gijswijt's proof was published in
            the Annals of Mathematics and is noteworthy for its clever use of
            elementary methods.

  title: Perfectoid spaces
  authors: Buzzard, Commelin and Massot
  abstract: |
            Perfectoid spaces are sophisticated objects in arithmetic
            geometry introduced by Peter Scholze in 2012. We formalised enough
            definitions and theorems in topology, algebra and geometry to
            define perfectoid spaces in the Lean theorem prover. This
            experiment confirms that a proof assistant can handle complexity in
            that direction, which is rather different from formalising a long
            proof about simple objects.

  title: The continuum hypothesis
  authors: Han and van Doorn
  abstract: |
            The continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinality between
            the smallest infinite cardinal and the
            cardinality of the continuum. It was posed by Cantor in
            1878 and was the first problem on Hilbert’s list of twenty-
            three unsolved problems in mathematics. Gödel and Cohen proved this
            is independent, i.e. neither provable nor disprovable, from ZFC.

  title: Data Types as Quotients of Polynomial Functors
  authors: Jeremy Avigad and Mario Carneiro and Simon Hudon
  abstract: |
            A broad class of data types, including arbitrary nestings of inductive 
            types, coinductive types, and quotients, can be represented as quotients 
            of polynomial functors. This provides perspicuous ways of constructing 
            them and reasoning about them in an interactive theorem prover.
