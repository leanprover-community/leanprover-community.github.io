  title: The cap-set problem
  authors: Dahmen, H√∂lzl and Lewis
  abstract: |
            In 2016, Ellenberg and Gijswijt established a new upper bound on
            the size of subsets of $ùîΩ^n_q$ with no three-term arithmetic
            progression. This problem has received much mathematical attention,
            particularly in the case $q = 3$, where it is commonly known as the
            cap set problem. Ellenberg and Gijswijt's proof was published in
            the Annals of Mathematics and is noteworthy for its clever use of
            elementary methods.

  title: Perfectoid spaces
  authors: Buzzard, Commelin and Massot
  abstract: |
            Perfectoid spaces are sophisticated objects in arithmetic
            geometry introduced by Peter Scholze in 2012. We formalised enough
            definitions and theorems in topology, algebra and geometry to
            define perfectoid spaces in the Lean theorem prover. This
            experiment confirms that a proof assistant can handle complexity in
            that direction, which is rather different from formalising a long
            proof about simple objects.

  title: Independence of the continuum hypothesis
  authors: Han and van Doorn
  abstract: |
            The continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinality between
            the smallest infinite cardinal and the
            cardinality of the continuum. It was posed by Cantor in
            1878 and was the first problem on Hilbert‚Äôs list of twenty-
            three unsolved problems in mathematics. G√∂del and Cohen proved this
            is independent, i.e. neither provable nor disprovable, from ZFC.

  title: Data Types as Quotients of Polynomial Functors
  authors: Avigad, Carneiro and Hudon
  abstract: |
            A broad class of data types, including arbitrary nestings of inductive 
            types, coinductive types, and quotients, can be represented as quotients 
            of polynomial functors. This provides perspicuous ways of constructing 
            them and reasoning about them in an interactive theorem prover.

 title: Liquid Tensor Experiment
 authors: Commelin, Topaz et al
 abstract: |
           Liquid vector spaces are crucial objects in Clausen and Scholze‚Äôs
           condensed mathematics framework blending number theory and
           functional analysis. The main theorem about them guarantees they have
           suitable properties to achieve that goal.

 title: The sphere eversion
 authors: Massot, Nash, van Doorn
 abstract: |
           Smale‚Äôs famous sphere eversion theorem ensures you can turn a sphere
           inside out in Euclidean 3-space. It is an instance of a much more
           general flexibility result due to Gromov.
           Its formalization shows that proof assistants are not limited to
           algebraic parts of mathematics and can handle differential topology.

 title: Fermat‚Äôs last theorem for regular primes
 authors: Best, Birkbeck, Brasca, Rodriguez, van de Velde, Yang 
 abstract: |
           Altough this is far from the general case of Fermat‚Äôs last theorem, the
           case of regular prime exponents is a nice test case for the
           foundations of algebraic number theory.

 title: Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture
 authors: Tao et al
 abstract: |
           This is a famous conjecture in additive combinatorics whose
           solution was announced in November 2023 and formalized in three
           weeks thanks to a large collaborative project.

 title: Cedar specification
 authors: Emina Torlak et al
 abstract: |
           Cedar is a language for defining permissions as policies, which
           describe who should have access to what. It is also a specification for
           evaluating those policies. The specification has been formalized and
           the implementation in Lean is used to check the Rust implementation
           by comparison.

           Cairo is a blockchain-based programming language. Various components
           of the language and its library have been formalized.
