        1: { summary: `<p>This course will be taught in the Spring 2025 semester for the first time. It will cover topics in a standard discrete-math course at entry undergraduate level (freshman and sophomore in the US). (The course name is therefore a bit of a misnomer, chosen in order to avoid a few turf issues at Boston University.) The reference textbook is Heather Macbeth's &quot;The Mechanics of Proof&quot;. Most of the enrolled students are majoring in computer science, with the remaining few majoring in mathematics or computer engineering. The course is intended to teach the rigor of mathematical proofs as well as various proof methods commonly encountered in the mathematical sciences. Students are assigned weekly homework exercises which they have to solve in one of two ways, or in both ways: (a) with Lean 4 and (b) in longhand &quot;paper-and-pen&quot; style. Lean 4 will also be used as a functional programming language, in particular, in homework exercises involving the implementation of standard algorithms and some of their variations on finite graphs.</p>

        3: { summary: `<p>This course will be taught in the Fall 2025 semester, a slight modification of the same title taught in the Fall 2024 semester. About half of the course will cover standard material of mathematical logic, with an emphasis on model theory, as taught in a first-year graduate course. The course will be limited to graduate students in computer science and mathematics. The material for the course will combine sections in the book &quot;Theorem Proving in Lean 4&quot; and the book &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to Logical Verification&quot;, in addition to lecture notes by the instructor on model theory.</p>

        4: { summary: `<p>This master's level course focuses on the theory and practice of proof assistants in mathematics, covering lambda calculus and dependent type theory foundations of proof assistants such as Coq, Lean, and Agda. In the practical part, students learn to use Lean together with Mathlib, and work in small groups on formalization projects on mathematical topics of their choice. Guest lectures are provided by Assia Mahboubi (VU/Inria, Nantes).</p>

        5: { summary: `<p>This course gives a systematic introduction to Lean 4, first as a functional programming language, and then a theorem prover. We explain the type theoretic foundations of Lean and show examples of theorem proving and tactics. The last part of the course covers Lean's compiler and metaprogramming system. The course is intended for both mathematicians and computer scientists. The contents covered include: Type Polymorphism, Monads, CIC, Subtyping, Tactics, Logic, Sets, Computability, Termination, Metaprogramming, Macros, Elaboration, Type Unification, and relevant works in other proof assistants.</p>

        7: { summary: `<p>The main mathematical topic of this course is elementary real analysis, especially the theory of convergent sequences and continuous functions. Since 2021 I use a controlled natural language for input in order to facilitate transferring Lean proofs to pen and paper proofs: the Verbose Lean library that can be found on GitHub.</p>
`, website: "https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~patrick.massot/enseignement/", material: "None", repository: "None", notes: `None`, experiences: `<p>This course really works well, and it will probably continue for a long time. The idea to use controlled natural language tactics seems a lot more efficient than the native syntax to ensure students improve at pen and paper proofs.</p>

        8: { summary: `<p>This is a two-part course for a small group of first-year double-major math &amp; CS students. The first part is about pen-and-paper proof, with a focus on logic, natural deduction and Peano arithmetic. The second part is a Lean 4 lab with worksheets on propositional and predicate logic, sets and functions, and natural numbers. The focus in on elementary theorems proved in tactics-mode in &quot;plain vanilla&quot; Lean (without the Mathlib), attempting to draw parallels with natural deduction.</p>

        12: { summary: `<p>This was an introduction to proving, programming and proving correctness (and termination) of programs in Lean.  The foundations of Lean were also discussed, as were more advanced topics like TypeClasses, Monads and Indexed Inductive Types. Students were also introduced to basics of meta-programming.</p>

A little over half the course consisted of live coding to explain various aspects of proofs, programs, proofs of termination and correctness etc. The last part was devoted to projects, with lectures a mixture of things students needed for their specific projects and  advanced topics like metaprogramming.</p>
` },
  
        13: { summary: `<p>This is a small seminar for master math students that took the previous Lean course and want to continue. It is a collaborative project where the students formalize some new results in analysis, this the aim to PR this to Mathlib, or make it somewhat Mathlib-ready. The topic is fourier analysis, in particular Plancherel's theorem, the interpolation theorems and their applications.</p>

        14: { summary: `<p>This is taught as a second-year mathematics undergraduate course. It introduces Lean 4 as well as Mathlib and demonstrates how to construct and do proofs on both basic mathematical objects, such as real numbers, as well as more advanced ones like p-adic numbers.</p>

        15: { summary: `<p>This course is completely bilingual between English and Lean, with every example presented both ways (students also have to solve every homework problem both ways). It's the standard syllabus of a US &quot;intro to proofs&quot; course for first/second-year undergraduates, covering &quot;proof techniques&quot;, good style in proof writing, elementary number theory, &quot;sufficiently large&quot;, recurrence relations, functions, relations, and set operations. The textbook &quot;The Mechanics of Proof&quot; (link above) was written for this course.</p>
`, website: "None", material: "https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001", repository: "https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001", notes: `None`, experiences: `<p>The course has been taught since 2023 and is now on its fourth iteration. The students like using Lean and are able to learn it at the pace required. I invested a lot of energy in writing custom tactics which perform exactly one step of reasoning that I would permit on paper, and deliberately never mentioned several more powerful tactics. This is very useful if the course is explicitly supposed to teach good style in proof writing. It lets you off the hook in grading -- you can just say &quot;that's not enough detail -- Lean wouldn't accept it!&quot;</p>
` },
  
        16: { summary: `<p>This is a large introductory course that is taken by most computer science students at Brown. It teaches logic, combinatorics, number theory, and probability, focusing on concepts that are important in computer science. In spring 2023 we introduced a Lean component to the course, to emphasize the concepts of proof and deduction. The goal is not to achieve Lean proficiency, but rather to bolster students' understanding of the traditional material.</p>
`, website: "https://cs22.io/", material: "None", repository: "https://github.com/brown-cs22/CS22-Lean-2024", notes: `None`, experiences: `<p>Given the size of the course and the momentum of the large TA staff, a full Lean integration is a multi-year effort. Students' ability to translate between formal and informal statements was significantly improved over the year before. I leaned heavily on the terminology &quot;context,&quot; &quot;hypothesis,&quot; and &quot;goal&quot; (inspired by the Lean infoview) and there were clear signs that this structure was influencing students' approaches to informal proofs.</p>
` },
  
        17: { summary: `<p>This is an upper level undergraduate/graduate course that teaches the theory and practice of proof assistants using Lean. Topics covered include verification of functional programs, PL semantics, mathematical structures, metaprogramming, and logical foundations. The course is based on Jasmin Blanchette's course Logical Verification and uses the Hitchhiker's Guide to Logical Verification as a reference.</p>

Final projects have included a verified executable DPLL SAT solver; the mathlib tactic <code>linear_combination</code> and initial work toward <code>polyrith</code> explorations of axiomatic ZFC, linear algebra, and other mathematical topics; formalization of domain theory; and more.</p>
` },
  
        18: { summary: `<p>Advanced class for Ph.D. students in Computer science, most of them working in formal methods.  It consists mostly of pen-and-paper exercises; only four classes are done in Lean. (1) Lean syntax, basic tactics, Cantor's theorem, Schröder-Bernstein theorem (2) partially ordered sets, complete lattices, pre/pos/fixpoints, Knaster-Tarski theorem (3) Kleene fixpoint theorem, induction and co-induction (4) concatenating lists, reversing lists, sorting lists (formally verify mergesort)</p>

        23: { summary: `<p>Since the advent of human communication, people have wanted to communicate privately. And others have wanted to listen in on those ostensibly private communication. Our modern situation where a large portion of our interactions occur online presents a special need for such security and an attractive target.
In this course, we cover the basics of cryptography starting from ciphers used in ancient times up to modern encryption and signature protocols. We focus on the mathematical foundations of both cryptography and cryptanalysis.
We employ Lean as our implementation language for the course and get a small glipmse of formal verification.</p>

        25: { summary: `<p>Project-based course aimed at undergrads and early grad students. The focus of the class was purely on the practical aspect of using Lean to state and prove mathematical statements. The intended outcome was not a deep understanding of how Lean works but having the practical skills of breaking down the problem, debugging it, asking for help on Zulip in a productive way, etc. The students spend the first 3 weeks doing exercises in MiL, and the other 7 weeks doing a project.</p>
`, website: "None", material: "None", repository: "None", notes: `None`, experiences: `<p>Students felt that the pace is too fast. No one completed more than 4-5 chapters of MiL. Projects mostly went well. Each team had two people -- a team leader, who proposed the project (grad student or student with previous Lean experience). This worked well in that the team leader moved the project forward but, on the other hand, the other team member struggled to keep up.</p>

This worked very well for a month, with a lot of questions and my adapting explanations. Once the projects started the decoupling of lectures and evaluation led to a sharp drop in attendance. I course corrected and made lectures into project demo/help/live-coding. Advanced students explaining what they had done and less advanced explained what they had, where they were stuck, what they needed etc and I (and their fellow students) helped them get unstuck. This is working well. Next time I teach I will transition earlier and in a more planned way to this mode.</p>

We worked through the current version (at the time) of the book Mathematics in Lean by Jeremy Avigad and Patrick Massot.  The course was closely modeled on a course taught by Jeremy Avigad at CMU in 2022.  Student did weekly homework implementing or completing the implementation for small example results, and they also produced a midterm and a final project where they implemented any mathematics result they chose.  Some example final projects were implementing the definitions and results of elementary group theory through Legrange’s Theorem and a proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.</p>

        48: { summary: `<p>A 1-semester course aimed at graduate students in algebra and related topics at Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt and Glasgow universities. Aimed to approach Lean as mathematicians and future formalisers, establishing proficiency in tactic mode. For the first part of the course we learned the basics of first-order logic in Lean using the tutorials project, before discussing some basics of types and type classes to talk about formalising algebra. Also made use of lftcm2020 exercise sheets, and MiL. Concluded with a hackathon working on some group projects.</p>
`, website: "https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~pkinnear/leancourse/", material: "None", repository: "None", notes: `None`, experiences: `<p>We tried to avoid touching on too much type theory early on to get people confidently interacting with Lean quickly. In retrospect, it would have been good to cover this in more depth (albeit only later in the course, after establishing confidence interacting with Lean) to aid in dealing with the inevitable issues that arise when formalising an interesting piece of mathematics. Also, we originally aimed for the outcome of the course to be group projects working on mathlib contributions, but would now say that re-framing the goal as formalising something new in a format that is useful to you as a learner (e.g. as a worksheet/interactive part of a textbook) is a better goal pedagogically (and could still lead to, e.g., a mathlib contribution in the process even if that isn't the explicit goal).</p>

        51: { summary: `<p>This was a week-long (20h) summer course introducing motivated high school students to formal mathematics. Half of the time was spent teaching on a blackboard Hilbert's axioms for plane geometry, while the other half was spent on a computer lab playing through several levels of a Lean game whose ultimate goal was to proof the plane separation theorem. This was the first experience for the students with both axiomatic mathematics and theorem provers. While the course was taught in Catalan, the game is written in English.</p>

The students would happily seat through the traditional-style lecture, but struggled when they had to code in Lean the proofs that they had previously discussed. This is in part because of Lean's unforgiveness, but we believe it is also due to the fact that they were unaware of some misunderstandings about the proofs, and Lean made those emerge.</p>

We decided to use Lean3 instead of Lean4 because of the easyness to install the <code>trylean</code> bundle, but will reconsider this decision next year.
