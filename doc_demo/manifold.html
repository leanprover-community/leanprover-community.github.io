<p>A manifold is a topological space M locally modelled on a model space H, i.e., the manifold is
covered by open subsets on which there are local homeomorphisms (the charts) going to H. If the
changes of charts satisfy some additional property (for instance if they are smooth), then M
inherits additional structure (it makes sense to talk about smooth manifolds). There are therefore
two different ingredients in a manifold:</p>
<ul>
<li>the set of charts, which is data</li>
<li>the fact that changes of charts belong to some group (in fact groupoid), which is additional Prop.</li>
</ul>
<p>We separate these two parts in the definition: the manifold structure is just the set of charts, and
then the different smoothness requirements (smooth manifold, orientable manifold, contact manifold,
and so on) are additional properties of these charts. These properties are formalized through the
notion of structure groupoid, i.e., a set of local homeomorphisms stable under composition and
inverse, to which the change of coordinates should belong.</p>

smooth category.</p>
<p>As a basic example, we give the instance

saying that a topological space is a manifold over itself, with the identity as unique chart. This
manifold structure is compatible with any groupoid.</p>
<h2>Implementation notes</h2>
<p>The atlas in a manifold is <em>not</em> a maximal atlas in general: the notion of maximality depends on the
groupoid one considers, and changing groupoids changes the maximal atlas. With the current
formalization, it makes sense first to choose the atlas, and then to ask whether this precise atlas
defines a smooth manifold, an orientable manifold, and so on. A consequence is that structomorphisms
between M and M' do <em>not</em> induce a bijection between the atlases of M and M': the definition is only
that, read in charts, the structomorphism locally belongs to the groupoid under consideration.
(This is equivalent to inducing a bijection between elements of the maximal atlas). A consequence
is that the invariance under structomorphisms of properties defined in terms of the atlas is not
obvious in general, and could require some work in theory (amounting to the fact that these
properties only depend on the maximal atlas, for instance). In practice, this does not create any
real difficulty.</p>
<p>We use the letter <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">H</span> for the model space thinking of the case of manifolds with boundary, where the
model space is a half space.</p>
<p>Manifolds are sometimes defined as topological spaces with an atlas of local diffeomorphisms, and
sometimes as spaces with an atlas from which a topology is deduced. We use the former approach:
otherwise, there would be an instance from manifolds to topological spaces, which means that any
instance search for topological spaces would try to find manifold structures involving a yet
unknown model space, leading to problems. However, we also introduce the latter approach,
through a structure <span style="background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;">manifold_core</span> making it possible to construct a topology out of a set of local
equivs with compatibility conditions (but we do not register it as an instance).</p>
<p>In the definition of a manifold, the model space is written as an explicit parameter as there can be
several model spaces for a given topological space. For instance, a complex manifold (modelled over
ℂ^n) will also be seen sometimes as a real manifold modelled over ℝ^(2n).</p>
