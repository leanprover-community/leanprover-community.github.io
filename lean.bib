  abstract      = {The ring of Witt vectors W R over a base ring R is an
                  important tool in algebraic number theory and lies at the
                  foundations of modern p-adic Hodge theory. W R has the
                  interesting property that it constructs a ring of
                  characteristic 0 out of a ring of characteristic p &gt; 1,
                  and it can be used more specifically to construct from a
                  finite field containing ℤ/pℤ the corresponding
                  unramified field extension of the p-adic numbers ℚp
                  (which is unique up to isomorphism). We formalize the
                  notion of a Witt vector in the Lean proof assistant, along
                  with the corresponding ring operations and other algebraic
                  structure. We prove in Lean that, for prime p, the ring of
                  Witt vectors over ℤ/pℤ is isomorphic to the ring of
                  p-adic integers ℤp. In the process we develop idioms to
                  cleanly handle calculations of identities between
                  operations on the ring of Witt vectors. These calculations
                  are intractable with a naive approach, and require a proof
                  technique that is usually skimmed over in the informal
                  literature. Our proofs resemble the informal arguments
                  while being fully rigorous.},

                  geometry. We formalize in Lean the basic theory of
                  discretely valued fields. In particular, we prove that the
                  unit ball with respect to a discrete valuation on a field
                  is a discrete valuation ring and, conversely, that the adic
                  valuation on the field of fractions of a discrete valuation
                  ring is discrete. We define finite extensions of valuations
                  and of discrete valuation rings, and prove some
                  localization results. Building on this general theory, we
                  formalize the abstract definition and some fundamental
                  properties of local fields. As an application, we show that
                  finite extensions of the field ℚp of p-adic numbers and
                  of the field Fp((X)) of Laurent series over Fp are local

                  procedures, pretty printer, and code generator. The new
                  system has a hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs.
                  It contains a new typeclass resolution procedure based on
                  tabled resolution, addressing significant performance
                  problems reported by the growing user base. Lean 4 is also
                  an efficient functional programming language based on a
                  novel programming paradigm called functional but in-place.
                  Efficient code generation is crucial for Lean users because

  abstract      = {In theorem provers based on dependent type theory such as
                  Coq and Lean, induction is a fundamental proof method and
                  induction tactics are omnipresent in proof scripts. Yet the
                  ergonomics of existing induction tactics are not ideal:
                  they do not reliably support inductive predicates and
                  relations; they sometimes generate overly specific or
                  unnecessarily complex induction hypotheses; and they
                  occasionally choose confusing names for the hypotheses they
                  introduce. This paper describes a new induction tactic,
                  implemented in Lean 3, which addresses these issues. The
                  tactic is particularly suitable for educational use, but
                  experts should also find it more convenient than existing
                  induction tactics. In addition, the tactic serves as a
                  moderately complex case study for the metaprogramming
                  framework of Lean 3. The paper describes some difficulties
                  encountered during the implementation and suggests
                  improvements to the framework.},

  abstract      = {Reusable symbolic evaluators are a key building block of
                  solver-aided verification and synthesis tools. A reusable
                  evaluator reduces the semantics of all paths in a program
                  to logical constraints, and a client tool uses these
                  constraints to formulate a satisfiability query that is
                  discharged with SAT or SMT solvers. The correctness of the
                  evaluator is critical to the soundness of the tool and the
                  domain properties it aims to guarantee. Yet so far, the
                  trust in these evaluators has been based on an ad-hoc
                  foundation of testing and manual reasoning. This paper
                  presents the first formal framework for reasoning about the
                  behavior of reusable symbolic evaluators. We develop a new
                  symbolic semantics for these evaluators that incorporates
                  state merging. Symbolic evaluators use state merging to
                  avoid path explosion and generate compact encodings. To
                  accommodate a wide range of implementations, our semantics
                  is parameterized by a symbolic factory, which abstracts
                  away the details of merging and creation of symbolic
                  values. The semantics targets a rich language that extends
                  Core Scheme with assumptions and assertions, and thus
                  supports branching, loops, and (first-class) procedures.
                  The semantics is designed to support reusability, by
                  guaranteeing two key properties: legality of the generated
                  symbolic states, and the reducibility of symbolic
                  evaluation to concrete evaluation. Legality makes it
                  simpler for client tools to formulate queries, and
                  reducibility enables testing of client tools on concrete
                  inputs. We use the Lean theorem prover to mechanize our
                  symbolic semantics, prove that it is sound and complete
                  with respect to the concrete semantics, and prove that it
                  guarantees legality and reducibility. To demonstrate the
                  generality of our semantics, we develop Leanette, a
                  reference evaluator written in Lean, and Rosette 4, an
                  optimized evaluator written in Racket. We prove Leanette
                  correct with respect to the semantics, and validate Rosette
                  4 against Leanette via solver-aided differential testing.
                  To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we port 16
                  published verification and synthesis tools from Rosette 3
                  to Rosette 4. Rosette 3 is an existing reusable evaluator
                  that implements the classic merging semantics, adopted from
                  bounded model checking. Rosette 4 replaces the semantic
                  core of Rosette 3 but keeps its optimized symbolic factory.
                  Our results show that Rosette 4 matches the performance of
                  Rosette 3 across a wide range of benchmarks, while
                  providing a cleaner interface that simplifies the
                  implementation of client tools.},

                  that they minimize when choosing between different ways to
                  lay out a document, and the performance of their algorithm.
                  This paper presents a new pretty printer, Πe, that is
                  strictly more expressive than all pretty printers in the
                  literature and provably minimizes an optimality objective.
                  Furthermore, the time complexity of Πe is better than many
                  existing pretty printers. When choosing among different
                  ways to lay out a document, Πe consults a user-supplied
                  cost factory, which determines the optimality objective,
                  giving Πe a unique degree of flexibility. We use the Lean
                  theorem prover to verify the correctness (validity and
                  optimality) of Πe, and implement Πe concretely as a
                  pretty printer that we call PrettyExpressive. To evaluate
                  our pretty printer against others, we develop a formal
                  framework for reasoning about the expressiveness of pretty
                  printing languages, and survey pretty printers in the
                  literature, comparing their expressiveness, optimality,
                  worst-case time complexity, and practical running time. Our
                  evaluation shows that PrettyExpressive is efficient and
                  effective at producing optimal layouts. PrettyExpressive
                  has also seen real-world adoption: it serves as a
                  foundation of a code formatter for Racket.},

  abstract      = {Functional programming languages are particularly
                  well-suited for building automated reasoning systems, since
                  (among other reasons) a logical term is well modeled by an
                  inductive type, traversing a term can be implemented
                  generically as a higher-order combinator, and backtracking
                  search is dramatically simplified by persistent
                  datastructures. However, existing pure functional
                  programming languages all suffer a major limitation in
                  these domains: traversing a term requires time proportional
                  to the tree size of the term as opposed to its graph size.
                  This limitation would be particularly devastating when
                  building automation for interactive theorem provers such as
                  Lean and Coq, for which the exponential blowup of term-tree
                  sizes has proved to be both common and difficult to
                  prevent. All that is needed to recover the optimal scaling
                  is the ability to perform simple operations on the memory
                  addresses of terms, and yet allowing these operations to be
                  used freely would clearly violate the basic premise of
                  referential transparency. We show how to use dependent
                  types to seal the necessary pointer-address manipulations
                  behind pure functional interfaces while requiring only a
                  negligible amount of additional trust. We have implemented
                  our approach for the upcoming version (v4) of Lean, and our
                  approach could be adopted by other languages based on
                  dependent type theory as well.},
