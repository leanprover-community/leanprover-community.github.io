  abstract	= {The ring of Witt vectors W R over a base ring R is an
		  important tool in algebraic number theory and lies at the
		  foundations of modern p-adic Hodge theory. W R has the
		  interesting property that it constructs a ring of
		  characteristic 0 out of a ring of characteristic p &gt; 1,
		  and it can be used more specifically to construct from a
		  finite field containing ℤ/pℤ the corresponding
		  unramified field extension of the p-adic numbers ℚp
		  (which is unique up to isomorphism). We formalize the
		  notion of a Witt vector in the Lean proof assistant, along
		  with the corresponding ring operations and other algebraic
		  structure. We prove in Lean that, for prime p, the ring of
		  Witt vectors over ℤ/pℤ is isomorphic to the ring of
		  p-adic integers ℤp. In the process we develop idioms to
		  cleanly handle calculations of identities between
		  operations on the ring of Witt vectors. These calculations
		  are intractable with a naive approach, and require a proof
		  technique that is usually skimmed over in the informal
		  literature. Our proofs resemble the informal arguments
		  while being fully rigorous.},

		  system has a hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs.
		  It contains a new typeclass resolution procedure based on
		  tabled resolution, addressing significant performance
		  problems reported by the growing user base. Lean 4 is also
		  an efficient functional programming language based on a
		  novel programming paradigm called functional but in-place.
		  Efficient code generation is crucial for Lean users because

  abstract	= {In theorem provers based on dependent type theory such as
		  Coq and Lean, induction is a fundamental proof method and
		  induction tactics are omnipresent in proof scripts. Yet the
		  ergonomics of existing induction tactics are not ideal:
		  they do not reliably support inductive predicates and
		  relations; they sometimes generate overly specific or
		  unnecessarily complex induction hypotheses; and they
		  occasionally choose confusing names for the hypotheses they
		  introduce. This paper describes a new induction tactic,
		  implemented in Lean 3, which addresses these issues. The
		  tactic is particularly suitable for educational use, but
		  experts should also find it more convenient than existing
		  induction tactics. In addition, the tactic serves as a
		  moderately complex case study for the metaprogramming
		  framework of Lean 3. The paper describes some difficulties
		  encountered during the implementation and suggests
		  improvements to the framework.},

  abstract	= {Functional programming languages are particularly
		  well-suited for building automated reasoning systems, since
		  (among other reasons) a logical term is well modeled by an
		  inductive type, traversing a term can be implemented
		  generically as a higher-order combinator, and backtracking
		  search is dramatically simplified by persistent
		  datastructures. However, existing pure functional
		  programming languages all suffer a major limitation in
		  these domains: traversing a term requires time proportional
		  to the tree size of the term as opposed to its graph size.
		  This limitation would be particularly devastating when
		  building automation for interactive theorem provers such as
		  Lean and Coq, for which the exponential blowup of term-tree
		  sizes has proved to be both common and difficult to
		  prevent. All that is needed to recover the optimal scaling
		  is the ability to perform simple operations on the memory
		  addresses of terms, and yet allowing these operations to be
		  used freely would clearly violate the basic premise of
		  referential transparency. We show how to use dependent
		  types to seal the necessary pointer-address manipulations
		  behind pure functional interfaces while requiring only a
		  negligible amount of additional trust. We have implemented
		  our approach for the upcoming version (v4) of Lean, and our
		  approach could be adopted by other languages based on
		  dependent type theory as well.},
