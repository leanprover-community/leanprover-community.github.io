  abstract      = {The ring of Witt vectors W R over a base ring R is an
                  important tool in algebraic number theory and lies at the
                  foundations of modern p-adic Hodge theory. W R has the
                  interesting property that it constructs a ring of
                  characteristic 0 out of a ring of characteristic p &gt; 1,
                  and it can be used more specifically to construct from a
                  finite field containing ℤ/pℤ the corresponding
                  unramified field extension of the p-adic numbers ℚp
                  (which is unique up to isomorphism). We formalize the
                  notion of a Witt vector in the Lean proof assistant, along
                  with the corresponding ring operations and other algebraic
                  structure. We prove in Lean that, for prime p, the ring of
                  Witt vectors over ℤ/pℤ is isomorphic to the ring of
                  p-adic integers ℤp. In the process we develop idioms to
                  cleanly handle calculations of identities between
                  operations on the ring of Witt vectors. These calculations
                  are intractable with a naive approach, and require a proof
                  technique that is usually skimmed over in the informal
                  literature. Our proofs resemble the informal arguments
                  while being fully rigorous.},

                  procedures, pretty printer, and code generator. The new
                  system has a hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs.
                  It contains a new typeclass resolution procedure based on
                  tabled resolution, addressing significant performance
                  problems reported by the growing user base. Lean 4 is also
                  an efficient functional programming language based on a
                  novel programming paradigm called functional but in-place.
                  Efficient code generation is crucial for Lean users because

  abstract      = {In theorem provers based on dependent type theory such as
                  Coq and Lean, induction is a fundamental proof method and
                  induction tactics are omnipresent in proof scripts. Yet the
                  ergonomics of existing induction tactics are not ideal:
                  they do not reliably support inductive predicates and
                  relations; they sometimes generate overly specific or
                  unnecessarily complex induction hypotheses; and they
                  occasionally choose confusing names for the hypotheses they
                  introduce. This paper describes a new induction tactic,
                  implemented in Lean 3, which addresses these issues. The
                  tactic is particularly suitable for educational use, but
                  experts should also find it more convenient than existing
                  induction tactics. In addition, the tactic serves as a
                  moderately complex case study for the metaprogramming
                  framework of Lean 3. The paper describes some difficulties
                  encountered during the implementation and suggests
                  improvements to the framework.},

  abstract      = {Functional programming languages are particularly
                  well-suited for building automated reasoning systems, since
                  (among other reasons) a logical term is well modeled by an
                  inductive type, traversing a term can be implemented
                  generically as a higher-order combinator, and backtracking
                  search is dramatically simplified by persistent
                  datastructures. However, existing pure functional
                  programming languages all suffer a major limitation in
                  these domains: traversing a term requires time proportional
                  to the tree size of the term as opposed to its graph size.
                  This limitation would be particularly devastating when
                  building automation for interactive theorem provers such as
                  Lean and Coq, for which the exponential blowup of term-tree
                  sizes has proved to be both common and difficult to
                  prevent. All that is needed to recover the optimal scaling
                  is the ability to perform simple operations on the memory
                  addresses of terms, and yet allowing these operations to be
                  used freely would clearly violate the basic premise of
                  referential transparency. We show how to use dependent
                  types to seal the necessary pointer-address manipulations
                  behind pure functional interfaces while requiring only a
                  negligible amount of additional trust. We have implemented
                  our approach for the upcoming version (v4) of Lean, and our
                  approach could be adopted by other languages based on
                  dependent type theory as well.},

                  approximately correct (PAC) learnability of the concept
                  class of decision stumps. This classic result in machine
                  learning theory derives a bound on error probabilities for
                  a simple type of classifier. Though such a proof appears
                  simple on paper, analytic and measure-theoretic subtleties
                  arise when carrying it out fully formally. Our proof is
                  structured so as to separate reasoning about deterministic
                  properties of a learning function from proofs of
                  measurability and analysis of probabilities.},
