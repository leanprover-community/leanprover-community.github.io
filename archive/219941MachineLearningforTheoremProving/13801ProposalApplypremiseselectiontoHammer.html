<p>Here is a project which I think is very doable for an enterprising person.  Recently, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span>  <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/slides/fomm_ebner.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/slides/fomm_ebner.pdf">incorporated an SMT-based "hammer" into a branch of Lean3</a>.  Right now, it uses TF-IDF (with cosine similarity) to select premises/lemmas.  However, Gabriel showed (on slide 28) that if one used better premise selection one could up-to double the success rate.  I think this is a ripe opportunity to apply the recent advancements in machine learning premise selection for theorem proving.</p>

<p>For supervised learning, Gabriel has already found a way to extract both the lemmas used in the original lean proofs as well as those used by the hammer.  This would make a great training set.  Then one could also apply reinforcement learning by using a trained premise selection model, extracting which lemmas have and have not been used, and then using this to train a new model.  Repeat until convergence.  Since the TF-IDF premise selector is already in C++, I imagine one could incorporate a trained TensorFlow model in there.  (And still do the training in Python by using his code to extract the lemmas used.)</p>

<p>Of course a learned model of premise selection would have trouble with never-seen definitions (unlike TF-IDF).  Google's HOList however showed that sometimes this is ok.  They trained a model on the core HOL Light library, but it did respectably on the Flyspeck library even though there were a number of new definitions.  Moreover, there is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02065.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02065.pdf">recent research by IBM</a> about this exact problem.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06904.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06904.pdf">one of the best results in the area of premise selection</a> (also by IBM) at least according to the two standard machine learning benchmarks (HOLStep and the Mizar dataset).  While this might be complicated for a first pass, I could imagine starting with something simpler.  There are a lot of references in that paper (including the original HOLStep paper).  Also, I think Isabelle's Sledgehammer uses naive Bayes for another example.</p>

<p>Of course, this might be premature as a project since Gabriel is still improving the hammer (or maybe this was already something he had in mind to add to it).  Either way, I could imagine using the dependency graph of Lean premises as another standard premise selection dataset (this one coming from dependent type theory).</p>

<p>Note that our DeepHOL-zero system for HOList <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10501" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10501">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10501</a> demonstrates how TF-IDF style similarity metric  can be combined with standard RL to bootstrap premise-selection without imitation learning. DeepHOL-zero achieves results that are almost at the level of systems that were trained with a combination of RL and imitation learning.</p>

<p>Yes.  I was going to mention your work too.  I forgot you used TF-IDF (or something similar) as a starting point.</p>

<p>TF-IDF is not spelled out explicitly, but we use a modified version of it. We have not reported the comparisons with the standard TF-IDF, but our variant was superior in our experiments.</p>
