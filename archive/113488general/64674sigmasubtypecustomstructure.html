<p>On <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/316" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/316">#316</a>, there are the following comments:</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110524">@Scott Morrison</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first is that this may encourage us to overuse <code>sigma</code> types and <code>subtype</code>s at the expense of bespoke structures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But somehow a bare <code>sigma</code> feels so low-level. Would it make any sense to replace it with a generic bundled structure? I guess it's basically the same thing...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I bring this up here because it is off-topic for that particular issue but is still an issue that I've wondered about myself.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://github.com/spl/lean-finmap" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/spl/lean-finmap">finmap</a> work, I've been using <code>sigma</code> as a singleton mapping between a key and value used in association lists and <code>finmap</code> itself. This is partly because it's already done in <code>hash_map</code> and partly because it's just the right type for the job. As far as the library goes, it works perfectly.</p>
<p>But in usage, it means that whatever I insert, I must use <code>sigma</code> instead of a custom <code>structure</code>. I then end up defining a type that is defeq <code>sigma</code>. I'd rather use a custom <code>structure</code> that then provides the appropriate interface used by the library. But I'm not sure if this is desirable or how best to do it. I can think of possibly using a type class or an equivalence.</p>
