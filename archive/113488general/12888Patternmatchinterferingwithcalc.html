<p>I'm currently working with equality elimination, and I frequently use patterns like <code>(eq::l)</code> when equality constraints are encoded as lists. I found that this interferes with the <code>calc</code> enviroment in weird ways.  Here's the minimal example I found so far: </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>lemma foo : ∀ x : list unit, unit
| []      := ()
| (eq::_) :=
  begin
    have h0 : 0 = 0 :=
    (calc 0
        = 0 : rfl
    ... = 0 : rfl)
  end

invalid occurrence of field notation
state:
foo : list unit → unit,
eq : unit,
_x : list unit
⊢ unit
</pre></div>


<p>The problem here seems to be that Lean isn't taking <code>eq</code> in the pattern as an arbitrary term of type <code>unit</code>, but as the actual <code>eq : Π {α : Sort u_1}, α → α → Prop</code> (the problem goes away when I rename it to something like <code>x</code>).  But this is strange since if Lean considered <code>eq</code> to be the latter, it would usually give a typechecking error and inform you that this <code>eq</code> cannot occur in a list of units. That's precisely what it does when there is, say, a <code>tt</code> in its place.</p>
