<p>What's the plan with branches for <code>mathlib</code>? We seem to have gone back and forth between using <code>master</code> and using <code>lean-3.4.1</code>. I'd just gone to the effort of creating <code>lean-3.4.1</code> branches in all my repos, and making them the default, so that <code>leanpkg upgrade</code> would successfully pull new changes from <code>mathlib</code>, but now it seems we've going back to using <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>I'm happy to do whatever is required, but would like some instructions on how to set up repos with dependencies <code>mathlib &lt;--- repoA &lt;--- repoB</code>, so <code>leanpkg upgrade</code> does what I hope it does. :-)</p>

<p>My guess is that the current instruction is: "set <code>lean_version=master</code> in all your leanpkg.toml files, and work on the master branch of <code>repoA</code>"</p>

<p>I am still planning on keeping <code>lean-3.4.1</code> branch up to date with master, but I expect that it may drift behind from time to time. Maybe you can consider it the "stable version", but it's really just me being lazy :)</p>

<p>I still really don't understand the algorithm <code>leanpkg upgrade</code> uses to pick which commit to go to. It seems to be affected by both the setting of <code>lean_version</code>, and perhaps the name of the branch you're currently in in your local repo?</p>

<p>Okay, I think the tooling is actually defective, and there's currently no way to have a chain of repos <code>mathlib &lt;--- repoA &lt;--- repoB</code> so that <code>leanpkg upgrade</code> tracks the master branch of mathlib.</p>

<p>(it _is_ possible to keep up with mathlib's 3.4.1 branch, by having repoA in a <code>lean-3.4.1</code> branch, and setting <code>lean_version="3.4.1"</code> in all the leanpkg.toml files)</p>

<p>I think it's unreasonable to expect someone to continuously sync one branch to another, especially without being written down as part of a process or a checklist. It will certainly be forgotten. If you really want branches synced, it should be automated (e.g. by cron).</p>
<p>I think mathlib — that is, both its users and its developers — would be better off following the standard practice of releasing numbered versions. A version provides a common checkpoint and ideally includes a description of changes from the last version. Mathlib versions will naturally change independently of Lean versions because they are independent projects.</p>

<p>A huge +1 from my army of undergraduate users, who just want to be told "install that version of mathlib and then do nothing until I tell you". And +1 from cocalc too.</p>

<p>Numbered versions for mathlib would be fine, but we'd need to switch to a numbering system that is independent of Lean, as we know that Lean versions can get stuck for a long time! Is there some mechanism for leanpkg to understand independent versions for Lean and for mathlib? It seems not.</p>

<p>Furthermore mathlib doesn't really have "releases" like a normal software project, it's basically a continuous stream of improvements, so the only reasonable versioning I can see is date-based</p>

<p>I agree with version numbers independent of Lean and with date-based version numbers. <a href="https://calver.org/" target="_blank" title="https://calver.org/">CalVer</a> appears to be a new name for the latter.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> But, just to be clear, a version number would label a “release” of sorts, right? I think the extreme alternative of considering every git commit hash a version creates too much work and confusion. From the developer's perspective, creating a new version generally involves some amount of work (e.g. documentation and packaging), so it should happen only occasionally. And from the user's perspective, it simplifies usage to work with batches of possibly-breaking changes rather than update with every single change.</p>

<p>for example, have mathlib nightlies labeled by date</p>

<p>But nightlies represent in-progress work, not released work. You want a release version to indicate some stopping point that describes some meaningful change wrt the last version.</p>

<p>Using nightlies as versions is no better than using commit hashes.</p>

<p>But that's just my point. In most software projects there is "in-progress" which becomes "release", but in mathlib it is either always in progress or never in progress depending on your point of view. I try to make sure all commits build, and for a formal verification project that's really the only measure of correctness besides style concerns. So you can literally make any commit a release and all you need is the packaging stuff</p>

<p>In metamath there is a <a href="http://set.mm" target="_blank" title="http://set.mm">set.mm</a> project that gets commits whenever people want to do something, and then every day or so the website is built (theorem display pages and crosslinks) - this is the build artifact - and that's it. The latest build is also hosted on the website. There is no further versioning applied; you can look at an old version if you want by checking out its commit.</p>

<p>A formal verification project acts like a software project in many ways, but this is one point of difference, I think.</p>

<p>And my points are these:</p>
<p>1. You've worked on computability features over multiple commits. There <em>is</em> a point at which you think you're finished. <em>That</em> is the point where you might make a release to describe to the world the changes you've introduced. (In this case, the release is a form of marketing.) You don't want to “release” every in-progress commit because the important news gets lost.</p>
<p>2. Users of mathlib as a library want to be able to look at what is currently considered “stable.” They also want to see what changes have been made over time, esp. if a user is transitioning from an old version to a new version. Nightlies don't give any indication of this because they are just builds. Versioning needs documentation, documentation takes time, and one doesn't want to spend that time every day. Also, you don't want to overload users with a huge number of versions because that just adds noise to the signal.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="http://set.mm" target="_blank" title="http://set.mm">set.mm</a> like a book if you want, learn set theory and what have you, or you can import it into your own theorems and prove something nontrivial without going through the basics</p>

<p>Mario, I think tagging something with a date is not so hard. So how about you "release" such a tag now and then? For example after the merge of a new "feature" (e.g. Scott's category theory) or something like quotient groups, or whatever.</p>

<p>Here's what I think a version release should minimally involve:</p>
<p>1. A name/number<br>
2. A <code>git tag</code><br>
3. Documentation of changes since the last release</p>
<p>Bonus:</p>
<p>1. Builds for various platforms as appropriate<br>
2. Announcement blog post or whatever</p>

<p>My users will update mathlib never. My users are using things like cocalc which has explicitly said it wants to update rarely. My users are using things like the computers in our departmental computer room which have explicitly told me that they will update precisely once per year, over the summer, and will not tolerate anything else. It would be lovely to tell my users "you're using mathlib v3.4.1" or "mathlib v1" or whatever. My users do not want bleeding edge mathlib so all this talk of changelogs is irrelevant to them. I'm just pointing out the existence of a large body of users for whom a lot of this talk is irrelevant, and stability and clarity would be extremely convenient. We will achieve stability with a git hash, but not so much clarity. I know you (Mario) have consistently resisted just randomly making a release but given that the topic has come up yet again I thought I would once more try to explain how people using Lean in completely different ways to you (people who want or have to solve my example sheet questions this coming October and who would like to have the same version of lean/mathlib running on all their devices) might appreciate something less messy than a commit hash. I still occasionally consider forking and freezing, but I really feel like this should be a last resort because all that will happen when I tell people to download mathlib from my GH will be that I'll end up with a bunch of undergraduates who think that I wrote mathlib.</p>

<p>I understand that there are other ways to make use of mathlib, but that's your business, not mine. I don't see why you can't pick a version of mathlib and make a big deal of it on your own without my intervention. It sounds like you are building your own product, based on mathlib, and you can version that however you like. There is no need for any of this to affect mathlib versioning.</p>

<p>Whether it involves you or not, it might be useful to have a coalition of library developers to select versions of <code>mathlib</code> that we standardize on. Otherwise, if you rely on two independent packages, they may rely on two subtilely different versions of <code>mathlib</code>.</p>

<p>It is fully possible that two independent packages can rely on slightly different versions of mathlib, and while this will not always cause an incompatibility (since in many cases you can update mathlib with no upstream changes), it might. But in this case, one or both packages is out of date, and should be updated to master.</p>
