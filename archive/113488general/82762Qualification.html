<p>The following situation is quite common.  I have a family of types <code>T α</code>  and maps <code>supp : T α → set α</code>, for example <code>T α = list list α</code> or   <code>T α = multiset α</code> or <code>T α = option α</code> or <code>T α = ℕ → α</code>.  In all these cases if <code>supp x  ⊆  s ⊆ α</code> then in ordinary mathematical language I can "regard <code>x</code> as an element of <code>T s</code>".  In Lean I have been calling this <code>qualify x h : T s</code>, where <code>h</code> is a proof that <code>supp x  ⊆  s</code>.  I then find that I need a long list of lemmas about this construction and its inverse.</p>
<p>Am I missing some kind of existing support for this?  Is there a better/more standard name that <code>qualify</code>?  Has anyone worked out a typeclass framework to treat all the different T's in parallel?</p>

<p>An example which <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> had last week was a direct sum of modules over an index set <code>α</code> and an equality of two elements in this direct sum; for each element he had a subset of <code>α</code> where the support of the elements was known to lie, and <code>s</code> was the union of these two subsets. He then wanted equality of the restricted elements in the direct sum over <code>s</code>. I noted at the time that a mathematician would pass over this without any further comment.</p>

<p>Neil, as I described in my talk in Amsterdam, Mario, Simon, and I have been working on a method of defining data types as "quotients of polynomial functors": <a href="https://github.com/avigad/qpf" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/avigad/qpf">https://github.com/avigad/qpf</a>. We were inspired by Isabelle's notion of a "bounded natural functor". Isabelle's BNFs come equipped with a natural transformation from <code>T</code> to <code>set</code> that has exactly the character you want. (I forget what they call it, but it is some cognate of <code>set</code>, IIRC.) We found that we can carry out the main constructions without <code>supp</code>, but it can be defined after the fact. For example, given <code>x</code> in <code>T alpha</code>, we can define <code>supp x</code> to be the union of the ranges of the "contents" parts of the representations of <code>x</code>. (We are grateful to Dmitry Traytel for this observation.)</p>
<p>We need to add another assumption to the definition of qpf for that <code>supp</code> to have all the right properties. For example, we can require that all the representations have the same range. Such an assumption will let us relate different ways of saying the same thing. For example, we can lift a predicate <code>P</code> on <code>alpha</code> to  <code>T alpha</code> without <code>supp</code>, but if we have <code>supp</code> and the assumption above, saying that the lift of <code>P</code> holds of <code>x</code> will be the same as saying that <code>P</code> holds of every element in <code>supp x</code>.</p>
<p>We haven't worked out the details yet, and we do not have a general axiomatization of the properties that <code>supp</code> should satisfy. (Maybe the one I just mentioned is enough?) We also don't have a good list of properties to derive. So if you come up with a good list, please share it!</p>
<p>That said, you might want to take a look at the reference manual for the Isabelle datatype package. Whenever you define a BNF, their package outputs a list of constructions and theorems, and you can focus on the ones that mention their <code>supp</code>.</p>
<p>I am running off to teach now!</p>

<p>There is no standard treatment of these functions, but there is a somewhat standardized name for when it comes up - <code>cod_restrict</code>. For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">linear_map</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">cod_restrict</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">submodule</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="n">β</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">γ</span> <span class="bp">→</span><span class="err">ₗ</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">α</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="n">β</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">H</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">∀</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="err">∈</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">γ</span> <span class="bp">→</span><span class="err">ₗ</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">α</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="n">p</span>

<p>The second assumption in each case is equivalent to <code>supp f ⊆ p</code> in your notation, but the details of how we want to say this vary from one pseudo-category to the next. <code>list</code> has a slight variation on <code>cod_restrict</code> called <code>pmap</code> which allows the function itself to be partial:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">list</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">pmap</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">Π</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">β</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">Π</span> <span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="bp">∀</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="err">∈</span> <span class="n">l</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="n">β</span>

<p>Thanks.  I will change the name to <code>cod_restrict</code>.  I agree that that it is more convenient not to formulate things in terms of <code>supp</code>, although that might change if we tried to build a systematic framework covering all cases.</p>
