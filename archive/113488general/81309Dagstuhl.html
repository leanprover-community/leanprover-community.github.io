<p>It was more the fact that Scott was quite a way from his laptop mic when he said it :-) I guess I agree with him that there's no point telling the staff to pay attention, that's why I'm telling the students.</p>

<p>After someone asked whether results will be tagged as to whether or not they were constructive, I had to bite my tongue to avoid saying this this meeting was the first time I had met in person someone with a job in a mathematics department who did constructive mathematics.</p>

<p>My impression is that computer scientists have a largely incorrect view about how much constructive mathematics goes on within a mathematics department. My impression is that most people that work in maths departments would have real trouble even stating what it means for a result to be constructive and giving basic examples of mathematics which is or is not constructive. If people in maths departments are doing constructive mathematics, my gut feeling is that they are doing it by accident.</p>

<p>as to whether they count -- sure they count, if they're working in a maths department. But perhaps it's also worth noting that even within the maths departments I've worked in, the logicians feel like a separate group to the rest of the researchers; Berkeley was a great example, where the logicians occupied a different floor to the other pure mathematicians and I think that in my 2 years there I didn't ever bump into any. On the other hand I had plenty of mathematical interactions with geometers, topologists and algebraists when I was there (I'm a number theorist). I very much felt with the logicians that it was a case of "they don't know anything about what we do, and we don't really care what they're doing, for the most part". Logicians have always felt very much like the outsiders in mathematics departments I've worked in. Of course this is just my personal impression.</p>

<p>It seems hiding in the most remote place at the other end of the world was a good strategy: all his colleagues fought among themselves, and Scott was the last one standing (at least this how it looks like in French newspapers).</p>

<p>It's true the only maths department I've been in with logicians was Berkeley. There I had some contact with them, but solely with the graduate students, essentially through the non-mathematical social life of the department.</p>

<p>This has all been very enlightening. I'm rather ignorant of what goes on in mathematics departments. This wasn't something we covered in any of my computer engineering, electrical engineering, or computer science courses or research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My impression is that computer scientists have a largely incorrect view about how much constructive mathematics goes on within a mathematics department.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My personal experience suggests that this is largely overstating the views of computer scientists. I'd guess that most of them actually do not know or care much about constructivism or whether it is used by mathematicians. It's a rather small group of computer scientists who actually use it in research, and they're vastly outnumbered by computer scientists working in other areas.</p>

<p>The research that goes on in maths departments (in the UK at least) is 99% classical logic being used to study what we call algebra, number theory, geometry, topology, analysis (and in the UK maybe some combinatorics), although these are pretty broad terms and what they mean changes all the time. Most of the people doing this have no idea what the law of the excluded middle or constructive maths is. You're right that the computer scientists I'm talking about are the ones I've met here though, which I'm sure is not at all a representative sample. Moreover, these mathematicians I'm talking about for the most part have no idea that things like Coq exist, either that or they do know but don't care.</p>
