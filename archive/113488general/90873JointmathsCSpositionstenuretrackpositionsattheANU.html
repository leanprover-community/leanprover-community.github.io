<p>There’s a lot of enthusiasm for advertising joint positions between the mathematics and computer science departments here at the Australian National University. There will probably be both tenure-track positions and possibly a senior level hire. If anyone is interested, or knows someone who is interested, please let me know and I’ll both mention their names in the process, and make sure they see the ads (when they are up, not yet!)</p>

<p>I’d love to see some interactive theorem provers apply! :-)</p>

<p>I also vote for hiring Simon and Ed! Provided of course that they promise to continue to help up on Zulip during European daytime.</p>

<p>When I was a post-doc in Berkeley I became completely nocturnal, so it could happen</p>
