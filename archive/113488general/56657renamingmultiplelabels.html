<p>I was just wondering if there was a tool, perhaps in Visual Studio Code, to rename the label of an assumption or have command, and have all the references to it be automatically updated to match? Or is it possible to have all the have labels in a proof be automatically renamed following a sequence in the order they appear, and have the references to them be updated to match?</p>

<p>There's a "change all occurences" option but this is just a text search-replace thing.</p>
