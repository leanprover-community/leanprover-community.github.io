<p>Starting on January 14th, I'll be teaching my <a href="https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/enseignement/math114/" target="_blank" title="https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/enseignement/math114/">Lean-powered undergraduate course</a> again. Last year I was so afraid of the installation procedure on Windows that I didn't tell my students to try to install Lean at home. But this turned out to be a huge issue. So I'm offering <strong>as much beer as you can drink</strong> during <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/index.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/index.html">Fomm2020</a> to anyone contributing to a download-and-click-only install of Lean+VScode+plugin+update-mathlib on Windows which then allows to download and unzip a project containing a compiled mathlib and use it without recompiling or typing any command in a shell. Ideally this should work on any version of Windows that my students could have, but having the main current version covered would already be nice. Useful starting points could include: <a href="https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_installer" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_installer">https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_installer</a> and <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/making-a-stand-alone-executable-from-a-python-scri" target="_blank" title="https://dzone.com/articles/making-a-stand-alone-executable-from-a-python-scri">https://dzone.com/articles/making-a-stand-alone-executable-from-a-python-scri</a> or similar (one can only assume students will have an installation of python fighting Lean, not helping it).

<p>Would an installer be necessary? It seems to me you could just make a zip file. Some combination of VSCode portable mode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable" target="_blank" title="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable</a>, configuring the VSCode settings file, and bundling Lean and Mathlib.</p>

<p>If that's the case, I agree with Andrew, throw everything in one zip with a configured portable VSCode. Maybe wrap it in a script that adds a shortcut or executable or something to open the right directory in VSCode.</p>

<p>The latest versions of CMake allow easier installer creation. When Lean4 rolls around I will investigate it if I have time, I recently had to do a lot of this kind of thing for work so I have some familiarity with it. It's a little arcane.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this (for the same sort of reasons) a month or two ago, and it seemed to me to be reasonable to say to the students "download VS Code by clicking here" but then I decided that the holy grail would be for them never to have to type a command into a command line, so ideally one would want one click which says "tell me a directory where you want to put your Lean stuff" and then installs lean (somewhere) + a tutorial repo with compiled mathlib (in the directory they chose) and also, ideally, installs the Lean extension for VS Code.</p>

<p>I tried to build Lean 4 in... November? The CMake build on Windows with Clang + Mingw wasn't working for me. There was some issue with the bootstrap procedure (I don't really remember what it was, because I only spent ~30 minutes investigating). Perhaps the Windows build works now? I have not tested it since then.</p>

<p>So I'm now exploring that portable mode in VScode. I manage to "install" VScode + lean plugin in user space. Now I can download lean and put it in the same folder.

<p>It seems that giving a full absolute path with backward separators works in the sense that it doesn't complain about lauching Lean. But then <code>#check nat</code> takes forever. I'll continue investigating tomorrow. But this is pointless if we can't solve that relative path issue.</p>

<p>Just now I set up a portable vscode on my Mac, but I couldn't get the extension to find Lean whenever I used any relative path (even <code>~/path/to/lean</code> didn't work). There's a semi-related issue <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/2809" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/2809">here</a> that I found after googling for "VS Code relative paths" (long story short, a keyword to use in settings paths that would stand for the location of the executable doesn't exist yet). </p>
<p>Maybe we could hack something in vscode-lean (or a fork?). <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38955116/how-does-an-extension-for-vs-code-get-the-install-path-of-vs-code" target="_blank" title="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38955116/how-does-an-extension-for-vs-code-get-the-install-path-of-vs-code">Apparently</a>, we can get the absolute path to the vscode-lean extension with <code>vscode.extensions.getExtension ("jroesch.lean").extensionPath</code>. Since the folder structure for the portable VS Code that you provide should be predictable, we should be able to use this method to give an absolute path to Lean?</p>
<p>I'll experiment with this a little bit more tonight, but no promises.</p>

<p>OK, <a href="https://github.com/bryangingechen/vscode-lean/tree/pmassot" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bryangingechen/vscode-lean/tree/pmassot">here's</a> a fork of vscode-lean which allows you to use <code>%extensionPath%</code> in the <code>lean.executablePath</code> and <code>lean.leanpkgPath</code> settings as a placeholder for the absolute path to the extension. You then can specify a relative path on top of that and hopefully that's enough for your needs. To test it out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone the repo and then <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#packaging-extensions" target="_blank" title="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#packaging-extensions">bundle it with <code>vsce package</code> to get a <code>.vsix</code> file</a>. Or if you trust me, you can download the attached file: <a href="/user_uploads/3121/0UiIdOqEwS-u0amZcBSOph_N/lean-0.14.8.vsix" target="_blank" title="lean-0.14.8.vsix">lean-0.14.8.vsix</a>. </li>
<li>Open the extensions tab in your portable version of VS Code and then click the three dots at the top right to "Install from VSIX".</li>
<li>Now open the settings and edit <code>lean.executablePath</code> and <code>lean.leanpkgPath</code> (the 2nd most likely doesn't matter since your students are not likely to use the leanpkg integration). The string should begin with <code>%extensionPath%</code> and then include a relative path from the extension folder inside <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable" target="_blank" title="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable">the "portable data" folder</a> to the Lean executable you want to use. E.g. I think <code>%extensionPath%/../../../lean</code> will point to <code>lean</code> in the same directory as the Visual Studio Code executable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I only did some minimal testing, so I'm not sure if you need to use forward slashes or back slashes on Windows.</p>

docker run -i -t Massot/Lean Lean<br>

<p>It would, in general, if the various releases of Lean were available as docker images.<br>
This will be especially true when Lean 4 drops. That way it would be possible to run Lean3 in one image and Lean4 in another at the same time.</p>

<p>Thanks Tim, but I don't really see the advantage of a docker image over the lighter "portable VScode  + lean" solution. None of those will really give you a native fully working environment and the docker solution looks much heavier (embarking a Linux distribution).</p>

<p>I'm coming back to the issue of trying to use Lean in windows. After some tests in Pittsburgh, I thought it was possible to distribute a zip file containing VScode, its lean extension, Lean and mathlib. But my students told me it doesn't work (Lean is constantly recompiling thousands of files). Indeed I now have a virtual machine with Win10 and it doesn't work. Does anyone know how to ask Lean why it's compiling?</p>

<p>Yes. I unzipped the files, ran the .bat, opened 00_appercu.lean, saw the recompiling behavior. Restarted the server a bunch, same behavior. Closed VSCode. in Git Bash, <code>find . | grep "[.]olean$" | xargs touch</code>. Ran the bat again. 00_appercu.lean opened and everything is compiled.</p>

<p>I also tried the zip file.  Directly after unzipping, lean tries to compile everything.  After <code>touch `find` </code> in git bash, everything works as expected (i.e., no compiling).</p>

<p>I mean, I don't really see what's crazy? There are olean time stamp issues on Linux too. It's not unreasonable to consider a file created at the moment it's unzipped, is it?</p>

<p>I mean, I unzipped it, I executed the bat file, then I opened <code>01egalites</code>, it didn't recompile anything and I could start proving stuff right away.</p>

<p>Haha, okay. I zipped my copy with the updated time stamps, moved it to a new folder, and unzipped it, both using the built in Windows 10 unzip tool. It kept the time stamps and works immediately.</p>

<p>Apparently windows helpfully resets the timestamp when you extract zip files.  But only for zip files that you've downloaded!</p>
