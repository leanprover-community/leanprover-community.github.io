<p>I just discovered <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/" target="_blank" title="https://keepachangelog.com/">Keep a Changlog</a>, which reminded me of our <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/subject/mathlib.20branches/near/128358255" title="#narrow/stream/113488-general/subject/mathlib.20branches/near/128358255">previous discussions</a> on mathlib releases.</p>

<p>Mathlib is an ongoing project without releases. You probably don't want a changelog for every commit. I think Mario once suggested that one could perhaps "pretend" that there's a release on the first of every month. Perhaps the community spending 5 minutes discussing what <em>major</em> things happened in the last month or so would be a good idea! For example I believe that this month we got polynomials in one variable.</p>
