<p>This is a follow-up to Mario's remark on "having existential statements", but I changed the thread title.</p>
<p>Here are the assignments Mario and I have assigned so far: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m8r6bhu8m0zv012/AABOy6lv93pViN1-eZvHrmMpa?dl=0" target="_blank" title="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m8r6bhu8m0zv012/AABOy6lv93pViN1-eZvHrmMpa?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m8r6bhu8m0zv012/AABOy6lv93pViN1-eZvHrmMpa?dl=0</a>. Most of it derives from things already in TPIL. Once I have survived the semester, I will work the material back in there. </p>
<p>Another update: I finally moved PIL to Sphinx, though I have not yet changed the contents at all (so everything is outdated and broken). It's here: <a href="https://avigad.github.io/programming_in_lean/" target="_blank" title="https://avigad.github.io/programming_in_lean/">https://avigad.github.io/programming_in_lean/</a>. Simon and I will try to get it into better shape. I hope to use it with the class in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Within the next couple of weeks, Mario and I need to start showing the class mathlib and showing them how to formalize "real" theorems. (Some will be more interested in writing little programs and proving things about their behavior.) I am a little anxious about that. We haven't yet figured out what to do, and I don't have good materials prepared. But we'll come up with something.</p>

<p>Glad to hear that PIL is moving - I hope I can share comments in a useful fashion.  Feel free to use me as a guinnea pig prior to sharing the material with your class.</p>
