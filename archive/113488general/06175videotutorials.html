<p>Inspired by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="282867">@Victor Ahlquist</span> 's question in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113489" href="/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members">#new members</a>  I made a video tutorial on how to solve the basic logical proposition he was asking about in both tactic mode and term mode:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POHVMMG7pqE" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POHVMMG7pqE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POHVMMG7pqE</a></p>
<p>Comments, especially constructive criticism, most welcome. It has taken me months to get round to start doing this kind of thing, but now I finally have all the hardware and software and knowledge I need, so in some sense the learning can start now.</p>
<p>One thing I've learnt from talking to people who know a lot more about this stuff than I do, is that apparently 10 minutes is the absolute max for stuff like this, and 5 minutes is better. I was aiming for 5 but over-ran. Still under 10 though. What am I supposed to say at the end? "Like and subscribe"?? :-)</p>

<p>Very nice video! I thought length was good for tactic mode, but for term mode it went slightly too fast for me at least. That might be because I haven't fully understood the lambda stuff yet though. The bracket way of proving an iff was also new to me which might have contributed to my confusion.</p>

<p>All the MOOC lectures are 10 minutes, apparently. I am a really bad person to make these at this point because I never watch youtube videos at all; this is why I'm keen to hear from people who might actually be interested in watching them.</p>

<p>My 17 year old son is currently upstairs writing a C++ game engine because he's bored, and got frustrated with unity so decided to make a 2d game engine himself. He seems to only watch 10 minute videos.</p>

<p>Fair enough. But I would say video length around 15 min seems to be okay.</p>

<p>ha ha he just came downstairs to get food, so I asked him to watch my video and his first question was "how long is it?". "Ten minutes", I said. "Oh yeah I'll watch that" he said.</p>

<p>great video!<br>
you might want to talk a bit more slowly.<br>
i think when people say that 10 minutes is the maximum they mean that the entire content should fit in that time frame at a regular speed. people will also quickly lose attention if it's too fast for them.</p>

<p>I feel like there is a general principle, here, similar to how you would structure papers and books. Long video lectures are bad because they are difficult to index and use as a reference; a lecture is better organized if it can be subdivided into smaller self-contained topics.</p>

<p>I never found lecture very enjoyable :/ I can read much faster than the lecturer can speak. I can't tell my lecturer to fast-forward through the preliminary bits and then stop for 10 minutes in the middle of a difficult derivation so I can figure out what's going on. So you just end up being a human blackboard copier and struggling through it yourself when you go home.</p>

<p>The great thing about recorded lecture is that I can rewind when I don't follow something, or continue on and come back to it if later material touches on the topic</p>

<p>that's true, but i personally quickly lose interest when i have to rewind the material often. i certainly do this for lectures, but i find myself doing it only very rarely with regular informational youtube videos.<br>
alternatively one can also control the speed of the video, but i only very rarely slow videos down, not sure why. i do however often speed them up when the lecturer is talking too slowly for me to keep focused.</p>

<p>As a reasonable young person, I'd say:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I randomly stumble upon your video because Youtube's algorithm believes I have weird entertainment preferences, making it shorter will drastically increase the chances that I'll click it on a whim.</li>
<li>If I'm specifically looking to learn Lean, you can make the video as long as you need. In this case, I'll much prefer a thorough and comprehensive treatment of the content to a rushed introduction.</li>

<p>Really great video, would love to see more! Perhaps one showcasing an area of mathlib? Depending on what your target audience is, you might consider explaining what notation like $ and &lt;&gt; mean, as you were more explicit when explaining the tactic mode. But maybe that's just because I'm more familiar with tactic mode. I've subscribed <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span></p>

<p>I'd have expected you to use <code>assume</code> instead of <code>intro</code> -- I think it looks less alien to newbies and goes better with the voice explanation, e.g. "so let us assume this as a hypothesis <code>*types 'assume hyp'*</code>" . Also, it would be nice if the link to the web-editor would already contain the problem statement you solve in the video :)</p>

<p>Another trick I missed is that I could have shown off a high-powered tactic like <code>tauto</code> or whatever -- something which just closes the goal immediately.</p>

<p>After <code>split,</code> you say "put some parentheses". I thought that means <code>()</code>, but you mean "braces" <code>{}</code>, right? (But you are the native speaker not me... so I guess I'm just wrong.)</p>
