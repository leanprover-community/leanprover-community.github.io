<p>When I was learning about <code>set_option pp.all true</code> a while back, I had recently proved that there was no rational number whose square was 3 in Lean, in no doubt an extremely inefficient manner. I wrote the proof term to a file and I just ran into it again yesterday.</p>

<p>I emailed it to my 15 year old son and he imported it into Blender, thickened up the characters, and then ran a platformer game on top of it, with a character with a really bad jump and quite a good grapple trying to get from one end of the proof to the other</p>

<p>I'm just taking the sound off it. The hitbox of the character is really small. Sometimes my son just takes gravity off and randomly moves around the proof.</p>

<p>If he ever gets bored, he should play Celeste next :)</p>

<p>oh I am such an idiot I switched the video off when he landed on the proof. He grappled around for a while after that. You just see the bit where he falls through the letters a lot here</p>

<p>oh the grapple will have to wait, it's bed time</p>
