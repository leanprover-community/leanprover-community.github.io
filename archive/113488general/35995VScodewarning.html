<p>Do you think the VScode extension could issue a warning if asked to work outside of a folder containing a leanpkg.path?</p>

<p>Gabriel has implemented this feature in the latest release! <span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span></p>

<p>Amazing, thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span>! Maybe the message is a bit too strong. In principle people could still want to work on a lonely Lean file using only core (or using mathlib installed inside HOME/.lean). The new message could tell it's unlikely to be good.</p>

<p>I'm writing that because, in the last couple of months, I noticed several users who would like a softer introduction to Lean, without creating a Lean project. I used to believe that assuming a sane python environment (or a sane way to create one) was a not a big requirement. But experience proves I'm wrong. There are too many users of user-hostile operating systems like Windows or MacOS. Maybe we should also be documenting a lighter way to get started, that only involves getting a precompiled Lean + one precompiled mathlib inside <code>~/.lean</code>.</p>

<p>Arg, <code>leanpkg install https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib</code> immediately tries to compile instead of letting people download oleans.</p>

<p>Maybe we should have mathlib-nightly offering a <code>.lean</code> folder to download. This way we could tell people: if do not want to use Lean seriously you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>download <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/releases/tag/v3.4.2" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/releases/tag/v3.4.2">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/releases/tag/v3.4.2</a> wherever you want, and make sure the <code>bin</code> folder gets added to PATH.</li>
<li>download a <code>.lean</code> folder from mathlib-nightly</li>
<li>download VScode+extension</li>
<li>starts creating random Lean files.</li>
</ul>
