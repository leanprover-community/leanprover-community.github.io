<p>In the lean server, if you send a sync command, e.g. even a one line file, and wait for the server to finish syncing (i.e. wait for a a current tasks response with no tasks), it will take about 0.2 seconds.  Why?  That seems really long in computer time.  Is it intentional?</p>

<p>is about .2 seconds.  (This is assuming you have already warmed up the server by sending it many requests.)</p>

<p>The intention behind that delay was to limit the number of messages from the server to the client.  With the delay, you get at most 5 messages per second.  If you'd send a message every time the server has done something, then there'd be a lot more messages.  In the editors, these messages just update the progress bar on the side so there's no need to be super fast.</p>

<p>Yeah, this question is really a consequence of the fact that a number of us are trying to basically hack the language server capability of lean to create a way to programmatically interact with lean.  This is really only an issue when I’m trying to interact with Lean in a tight loop.  For example, I send something to Lean, see if it works, and based on that send something different to Lean.  Anyway, it is annoying but not that big deal since the applications I have in mind can either get around the delay by putting multiple commands in the same file or just live with the delay.  Also the language server has larger issues that create more headache for programatic interaction with lean than this delay.  Thanks for the answer.</p>

<p>Yes, we are clearly bending the tool here. But this is not a bug, this is a feature. One of the motivation for my work on <code>lean-client-python</code> is that someone will hopefully soon start working on Lean 4 server mode, (and hopefully that someone is reading Zulip) and I hope to provide input about what users may want besides what we already have.</p>

<p>If you want to interact with Lean in a tight loop, then my suggestion would be to write your own server as a Lean program.  Just a small read-eval-print-loop that accepts the commands you want.</p>

<p>Yeah, if I understand your use case(s) (ML?) correctly, you should have much better and fine-grained options in Lean 4 such as playing your own elaborator than anything superficial you can do via a server API</p>

<p>Sebastian, what you say seems fair, but there are still people who will want to interact with Lean from another programming language, building interactive interfaces that don't look like a text editor, hence my experiment with Qt (which comes from a real project by Frédéric and Florian).</p>

<p>If the LSP is sufficient for your needs, great, but otherwise it's probably easier to write a small Lean 4 library that exposes a C interface to the internal Lean functionality you need. Then you can use that anywhere you want.</p>

<p>I definitely look forward to Lean 4, but I guess I'm too inpatient to wait. <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span>  One application I have in mind is as follows, which I think I can implement directly in Lean 3.  It would take in the following commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give Lean an expression to set as a theorem.  Lean creates a new tactic state trying to prove that theorem.</li>
<li>Give it a tactic expression to apply (possibly in a restricted tactic DSL) to this state.  Lean applies it and gives the state and an index for the state.</li>
<li>Given Lean an index for a previously visited state.  Lean jumps back to that state.</li>
</ol>
<p>The largest challenges will be: (1) Creating the tactic DSL which is tedious and I'll do one tactic at a time. (2) Making sure I can set up the environment as needed.  (What if my theorem needs a universe u?).  (3)  Making sure I can enter expressions to Lean either as Lean code or in another form (s-expressions based on the internal Lean expression representation).</p>

<p>it annoys me that there is no place in the grammar to put universe declarations in an <code>example</code></p>

<p>Why do we need to declare universes in the first place?</p>

<p>That's... a good question. Coincidentally I learned about <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2115-argument-lifetimes.md" title="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2115-argument-lifetimes.md">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2115-argument-lifetimes.md</a> today, a very similar argument could be made about universes.</p>

<p>Maybe we should make a list of all this things we've tried to hack the Lean server to do so that it is clear the sort of stuff we'd love from Lean 4.  Here are some things:</p>
<ul>
<li>find all tactic keywords and their states when they are applied (often can do in Lean 3 but with many exceptions)</li>
<li>find the entire tactic command from beginning to end.  (Note really doable in Lean 3.)</li>
<li>find all instances of the rw tactic (or the have tactic) so I can replace it with another tactic.  (Finding tactic instances is hard.  The Language server helps, but sometimes behaves weird.)</li>
<li>replace a tactic- or term-proof of a declaration with another (maybe I'm trying out some automation and I want to see what declarations I can prove with that alone)  (I have no idea how to find the start and end of a proof)</li>
<li>full proof recording (break up a proof into a data structure which can be used to replay the proof).</li>
<li>record theorems, states, etc in such a way that they can be consistently entered back into Lean.  (Often fails in Lean 3 usually because of issues with @.)</li>
</ul>

<p>In Lean 3 at least we had <code>universes</code> vs <code>universe variables</code>, but there's only one kind of universe variable in Lean 4</p>

<p>Jason, you last point is known as the pretty-printer roundtrip issue, and they very much work on it. Search for delaborator in Lean 4 code.</p>
