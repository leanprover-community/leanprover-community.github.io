<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> I am sorry I missed your hammer talk.  I look forward to seeing the video later.  In the meantime I read the slides and have some questions (which might have been answered in the Q&amp;A).  First, I want to say that this looks great!</p>
<ul>
<li>How useful would it be to improve the premise selection algorithm (using possibly a trained model)?  Do you think that would be a benefit or is TF-IDF-based premise selection currently good enough?</li>
<li>I didn't realize that Lean tactics could call C++ code.  Is this hacked into the Lean source code?  How easy would it be to swap out your tactic with another custom tactic using a mix of Lean and C++ code (or all C++ code)?  (For example, any neural based tactic would probably need to call TensorFlow or PyTouch.)</li>
<li>Less extreme, how easy would it be to swap your premise selector with another?</li>
<li>Finally, how easy would it be to extract the information used by the hammer?  Specifically, there could be some nice datasets that could come out of this.  The one I have in mind is (a) the statements of all the theorems you attempted to prove, (b) the available premises to use for that theorem, (c) the premises selected by TF-IDF cosign similarity, (d) the ones used by the SMT solver, and (e) the ones used by the other tested tactics (like library_search).  (And if possible and easy, (f) the ones used in the original proof.)</li>
</ul>

<p>About your second question: I'm pretty sure the hammer tactic calls C++ code the same way the built-in tactics do. That is, Gabriel modified Lean itself to add some C++ code and export it to Lean via a meta constant.</p>

<p>for the last question, (iirc) the hammer currently translates theorems in <code>mathlib</code> to TPTP, and it would be easy to use his setup to extract a dataset (of just theorem statements) in that format</p>

<p>There is lots of room for improvement here.  Slide 28 shows the results we get if we select the lemmas contained in the proof term of the existing proof.  Choosing the lemmas from the proof term doubles the success rate on average.</p>

<p>Is this hacked into the Lean source code?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.  It's in this file in my branch: <a href="https://github.com/gebner/lean/blob/05a7e979a1d8f87a2c4c6266dec0efd9bb03afa9/src/library/feature_search.cpp" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/gebner/lean/blob/05a7e979a1d8f87a2c4c6266dec0efd9bb03afa9/src/library/feature_search.cpp">https://github.com/gebner/lean/blob/05a7e979a1d8f87a2c4c6266dec0efd9bb03afa9/src/library/feature_search.cpp</a></p>

<p>If you have C++ code, you'd need to modify the Lean source code to call it (but that's not too hard, see <a href="https://github.com/gebner/lean/blob/05a7e979a1d8f87a2c4c6266dec0efd9bb03afa9/src/library/feature_search.cpp#L242-L258" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/gebner/lean/blob/05a7e979a1d8f87a2c4c6266dec0efd9bb03afa9/src/library/feature_search.cpp#L242-L258">https://github.com/gebner/lean/blob/05a7e979a1d8f87a2c4c6266dec0efd9bb03afa9/src/library/feature_search.cpp#L242-L258</a> for the part that does this).  Another option is to call an external program (and parse stdout).  In either case you'd need to modify the lean part to call the new selection code (not too hard either, but I haven't made an API to add other lemma selection algorithms).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> have you considered, longer term, cooperating with prover authors so that they output more detailed proofs?<br>
For example, as far as I can tell, E-HO could possibly be modified to output not just the DAG of clauses produced by superposition, but also the substitutions used at each step. That makes proof reconstruction much easier since steps are either instantiations or essentially ground inferences.<br>
I imagine that it'd incur a slowdown but that's a tradeoff.</p>

<p>For the evaluation in the slides I've used this wonderfully hacky piece of code: <a href="https://github.com/gebner/mathlib/blob/f4120984839677564fabf5b80f7203374dc832ca/src/tactic/hammer/do_eval.lean#L80" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/gebner/mathlib/blob/f4120984839677564fabf5b80f7203374dc832ca/src/tactic/hammer/do_eval.lean#L80">https://github.com/gebner/mathlib/blob/f4120984839677564fabf5b80f7203374dc832ca/src/tactic/hammer/do_eval.lean#L80</a>  It prints lots of stuff to stderr using a very ad-hoc format.  All of the ones you have in mind are somewhere in that file, e.g. <code>axs</code> on the line I linked to is the list of lemmas selected using the lemma selection and <code>lems.map prod.fst</code> is the list of lemmas used by the external prover.</p>
