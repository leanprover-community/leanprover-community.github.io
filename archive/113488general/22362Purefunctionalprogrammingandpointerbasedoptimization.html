<p>Hi all! Here's a shameless plug of a paper I wrote with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="230999">@Daniel Selsam</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112857">@Leonardo de Moura</span> about programming techniques that can sometimes get us exponential speedups on functional programs written on expressions. Comments and questions welcome.</p>

<p>That's true and we're going to get duplicates if looking up two objects encoding the same value. That's one possible trade-off we can choose and it can be very appealing to pay the price</p>

<p>In the context that we studied, we needed the value of the pointer at the same time that we were producing the value so we're pretty much merging <code>ptrAddr</code> and <code>Squash.lift</code></p>

<p>I'd love to see an example of that if you find one. My intuition is that it's going to be hard to make use of the pointer long term because globally, we can't even prove that two objects are equal if their addresses are equal</p>

<p>You are right, it is subject to the same limitations as <code>PtrCache</code> that I mentioned above. This <code>getPtr</code> function has properties that can be exploited but cannot be expressed in lean, so it will be possible to write correct programs (using only safe code) that cannot be proven correct</p>

<p>We were planning on including mutable cells in the paper but then we found this <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39634-2_24" target="_blank" title="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39634-2_24">paper</a> and noticed that they had all our examples and because they are extracting to OCaml, they did not have to deal with the issues of implementing it in a pure programming language</p>

<p>With <code>PtrCache</code> we still have a proof of functional correctness. We just can reason about duplicates, cache hits / miss. Also, the pointer itself doesn't give you anything that the value doesn't give you. With the value, you can use its pointer and you can dereference it (i.e. you look at the value itself). If you only have the address, you lose access to the value</p>

<p>You can dress that up with a pointer cache, but it's ultimately the same problem. If you store x in a hash table at location <code>hash &amp;x</code>, then if you later look up the bucket for <code>hash &amp;x</code> you will get a bucket that contains x, but you can't prove that</p>

<p>As I said, there's a whole area where we can't specify the properties. If your specification is about addresses (e.g. if you're writing a device driver), this won't cut it. If you want to write a program that computes a value but you want to go faster, you can get a proof of functional correctness with our approach</p>

<p>If you look at page 14, the proofs are in the types. We're using subsingleton's and subtypes which very neatly encapsulates them</p>

<p>We agree. There's a whole lot that you can't do. But you can optimize your programs and prove that you're producing the same behavior. Pointers have only a superficial presence in the logic even if you get a narrow window into the run-time with these features.</p>

<p>I saw that <code>Semidecidable</code> was recently added. I think that this type can be usable in these kind of contexts, but it has to be squashed (e.g. <code>isPtrEq x y : Squash (Semidecidable (x = y))</code>)</p>

<p>If you have a value of <code>Decidable p</code>, that's a proof that <code>p</code> is decidable. If you have a value of type <code>SemiDecidable p</code> (if you call it that), it's not a proof that <code>p</code> is semi-decidable.

<p>The usefulness of the fuel vs the <code>roption</code> trick are very different. The point of the fuel is to permit functions for which we don't bother proving that they terminate and still be able to run them. Not having an equation compiler yet and well-founded recursion, that's often useful for code we want to run but not prove anything about it</p>

<p>It's inconvenient with the calling code. Right now, we don't have tactics to do a lot of proofs and we don't have an equation compiler but we still need to write the compiler and the prover itself. I don't know if partial is here to stay but at the moment, it's a good solution</p>

<p>I think regardless, Lean 4 is going to be a step forward. If you do manage to prove its correctness, that's going to be interesting.  Now that it's in large part written in Lean, that <code>Expr</code> is in safe code, that might be more accessible. At the very least, I think a lot of mistakes are being ruled out so we can make progress faster</p>

<p>I looked into it a while ago, and I forget the details, but I think this constant is marked such that you can't use it in proofs. It interacts with <code>partial</code> functions in a weird way though and having a "largest natural number" lying around doesn't make me happy</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what number it is, it's a <code>nat</code> and lean knows that <code>nat</code> has certain properties. For example if you evaluate a partial function at depth <code>infinity+1</code> then it will return none, even if in reality this is impossible</p>

<p>Now I wonder if you can combind the pointer equality trick, which gives you true properties that you can't prove (two calls to <code>withPtrEq</code> give the same result), with the infinite recursion, which gives you true but not finitely observable properties that you can disprove (the <code>partial</code> function <code>f 0 = 1</code> and <code>f(n+1) = f n</code> never returns <code>0</code>), to get a true and finitely observable fact that is disprovable</p>

<p>(I'm still reading through the discussion, I hope I didn't miss too much.  These are just my first thoughts after skimming the paper.)  I like that these features will be available in Lean 4.  However the paper comes across as unorganized and without a clear and uniform design.  There are two primitives for pointer equality tests, <code>withPtrEq</code> and <code>withPtrEqResult</code>.  (For some reason there's only one version of <code>withPtrAddr</code> and <em>of course</em> it works like <code>withPtrEqResult</code> and not like <code>withPtrEq</code>....)  And then there's squashes thrown in as yet another way to do the same thing: i.e., to control the elimination principle.  I think it would be good idea to reduce the number of primitive (concepts) here.  Why can't you just add <code>ptrAddr : α → ∥Addr∥</code> and <code>ptrEq : ∀ a b, ∥PtrEqResult a b∥</code> like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> suggested?  Then it would be clear that all such "implementation details" like pointer equality are supposed to be in the squash monad.  And you only need to learn one elimination principle.  Or if that's too sophisticated, present at most one of the variants, i.e., only <code>withPtrEqResult</code> and not <code>withPtrEq</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Result</code> structure is also somewhat confusingly named.  1) It is not related to <code>PtrEqResult</code>.  2) It is not related to Rust's <code>Result</code> (= <code>Except</code> = <code>Either</code>).   3) Why does it even mention the function and argument separately?  <code>def Result (y : β) := { output // output = y }</code> works as well.  4) I like subtypes better, how about <code>{ output // output = f x }</code> instead of <code>Result f x</code>?</p>

<p>What I was getting at is that, if 10% of Lean is implemented at all, that means that we have very few features to rely on to write Lean in Lean itself. When we go up to 20%, new features are available and we can make use of them in the implementation of Lean. Loops are something that we need from day 1 and well-founded recursion is not the first feature on the list. <code>partial</code> is a great way around that even if it is schedule to disappear after WF recursion comes in -- I don't know if it actually is scheduled but when we do have WF recursion or even general recursion, you don't have to care about <code>partial</code> in the programs that you write and prove</p>

<p>There is a general mechanism to take the equations of the equation compiler and produce a relation that relates all input values to all calls (where it should be "decreasing"). You construct an inductive relation with these constructors and then <code>acc</code> applied to that is the unique most general well foundedness condition, that allows you to say "a function with these equations computes here". There are no constraints on this compilation procedure, assuming the arguments have been tupled up as in lean 3 wf recursive compilation.</p>
<p>The upshot is that you can write any equations you want, and you can produce a function from some proposition, asserting that the particular input terminates, to the result value. If you don't want to prove well foundedness, you can either call it in the <code>roption</code> monad, or you can pass a fake proof. Writing the equations and proving termination become separated, and you don't need any magic at all.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This probably refers to "petrol-driven computation". If you have a computation whose halting behaviour you don't know, a total language might not let you run it (because it might not terminate); but you can still always run it for some maximum number of computation steps, unfolding the state of the computation as you go. After a thousand steps, maybe it's terminated or maybe it hasn't, but you can certainly unfold the computation up to that point. We say you've "provided 1000 fuel" to the computation, and this may or may not be enough to complete it.</p>
