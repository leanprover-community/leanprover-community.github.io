<p>I am really interested in this idea and in the CS culture in general. Mathematicially you have done something which is 100 years old so the new ideas are not there. In computer science I would <em>imagine</em> that you are not the first person to formalise Hensel's Lemma. Am I wrong about this? And even if someone else had done it in Mizar in 2009 or whatever -- would this matter? I am trying to work out which notions of "value" a potential referee would attach to a paper such as this.</p>

<p>Obviously I ask because if I get the schemes repo and/or the perfectoid repo into shape then I will be thinking about the same sort of thing, but I have no idea how it works.</p>

<p>If I were supervising a Masters student who wanted to do something involving Hensel's Lemma I would have told them to prove it for an arbitrary complete DVR and then prove that the p-adic numbers are a complete DVR. The fact that this machinery is not in Lean somehow makes this less convenient. Yes, let me also congratulate you on the draft :-)</p>

<p>The philosophy here is that proving Hensel's Lemma for the p-adics is a way of putting the library through its paces. How did you get the status of Hensel's Lemma in all the gazillion other proof assistants? Presumably I'll have to do this with schemes one day.</p>

<p>I think that is a lot easier. I'm pretty sure nobody has done that before. (Although I've seen slides by Coquand on constructive algebraic geometry. But that didn't do any sheaves. It just defined <code>Spec A</code> as a locale [~~ <code>open_set</code>].)</p>

<p>The expectation for this kind of paper is that the subject hasn't been formalized before, or that you've formalized it in a novel and interesting way, and typically that it's part of some broader project. It isn't novel math, but it's a novel formalization, that shows off features of Lean and mathlib, that's a building block for work we plan to do in the future. And of course there's no guarantee that it gets accepted!</p>

<p>There aren't really a gazillion other proof assistants to check. It's easy enough to see what's in the Isabelle AFP, Mizar MML, and HOL Light library, they're all pretty self-contained.</p>

<p>Coq is trickier since it's a bit more fragmented, but Google "p-adic numbers coq" or "hensel's lemma coq" turns up what exists.</p>

<p>Maybe for you -- it sounds a bit scary to me! I can't even read mathlib, and that's in a language that I kind-of know! Have schemes or perfectoid spaces been done before?</p>
<p>But your message answers my question very well -- thanks. I saw that someone had a paper or some sort of a write-up at least on formalising localisation of a ring in some other theorem prover and my first thought was "Kenny did that in Lean when he was a first year undergrad". If you want to explain another reason why it's part of a broader project, you can say that it's part of the 4th year undergrad curriculum at Imperial College London (p-adic numbers and Hensel's Lemma are part of the elliptic curves course, which I designed about 15 years ago) so they're an essential part of my plan to digitise the entire pure maths curriculum! And anyway, this universe is so real-number-centred and I've never understood why, the p-adic numbers are just another completion of the rationals, I don't know why we don't teach them to schoolkids.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I strongly suspect that they haven't. A quick look at Google doesn't turn up anything relevant for perfectoid spaces. This is a new and deep concept, if it's been formalized it won't have been done silently. Schemes are harder to search for because the word is used another way in logic, but I don't see anything at a glance.</p>

<p>I wonder if existing decision procedures for Presburger arithmetic could apply directly to p-adic numbers or if instead one would need to explicitly model the "wrapping" using existentially quantified variables over a domain <code>\mathbb{Z}</code>.</p>

<p>Just like you can't squeeze all real numbers into 32 bits. But here is a consequence -- it means that you have trouble distinguishing rational from irrational numbers in <code>float</code> because you've lost information which from a "am I far from the right answer" position is small, but from a "have I lost any arithmetic information" is big</p>

<p>Here the interesting part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously  there  is  no  direct translation of concepts like linear inequalities and Barycentric Division to non-ordered fields, such as the p-adic ones. Nevertheless we want our p-adic polytopes and simplexes to be defined by conditions which are as simple as possible, to obtain a notion of faces satisfying all the above properties, and most of all to develop a flexible and powerful division tool. This is achieved here by first introducing and studying certain subsets of Γm called “largely continuous precells modN”, for a fixed m-tuple N of positive integers.  These sets will be defined by a very special triangular system of linear inequalities  and  congruence  relations  modN.   In  particular  they  are  defined simply by linear inequalities in the special case where N= (1,...,1) ...</p>

<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We extend the binary congruence relations of Z to Γ with the convention that a≡+∞[N] for every a∈Γ and everyN∈N.  A subset A of FI(Γm) is a basic Presburger set if it is the set of solutions of finitely many linear inequalities and congruence relations.  Although we will not use it, it is worth mentioning that, by the quantifier elimination of the theory of Z in the language LP res, the definable subsets of Z d, and more generally of Γm, are exactly the finite unions of basic Presburger sets.</p>

<p>If P has access to mysterious operations that measure x and y jointly, then it is possible that x=y is just a single instruction in the machine and so the theorem won't hold. Instead, we assume that each branching operation measures some property of either x or y but not both at the same time. (Stuff like comparing the first bit of x against the first bit of y can be split into two branches to measure first x then y.)</p>

<p>Looks like I missed an interesting conversation, but just to answer the easy questions at the beginning! <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="122318">@Tobias Grosser</span> indeed, referencing a git hash would be ugly but more stable. I'll try it out. The construction does require <code>p</code> to be prime. I don't even have a picture of what Presburger arithmetic over Z_p would look like since there's no ordering. Maybe there's an answer in the polytope paper you linked, that looks super interesting.</p>

<p>Regarding the lack of ordering, in our compiler we associate to comparisions the information if a comparision should be interpreted as signed or unsigned.</p>

<p>I took a quick look at that paper and it was a bit hard to understand what their goal was, in part because the paper seemed to be setting up some background theory for a subsequent paper. But as far as I can tell, it talks about Presburger arithmetic not on Z_p or Q_p directly but on N or Z via the p-adic valuation.</p>

<p>You could also say that Presburger arithmetic on N is really just the first order theory of addition (and zero) because an inequality <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>≤</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a \le b</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.83041em;vertical-align:-0.13597em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit">a</span><span class="mrel">≤</span><span class="mord mathit">b</span></span></span></span> can be represented by <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∃</mi><mi>c</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\exists c, a + c = b</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathrm">∃</span><span class="mord mathit">c</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mord mathit">a</span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mord mathit">c</span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mord mathit">b</span></span></span></span>.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>  what does it mean to perform presburger arithmetic on the p-adic valuation?</p>

<p>Well the p-adic valuation of a p-adic integer is a natural number, and Presburger arithmetic is the theory of natural numbers under zero and addition. So we're talking about formulas like "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_p(x) = v_p(y) + v_p(y) + 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.75em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1.036108em;vertical-align:-0.286108em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">v</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15139200000000003em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.03588em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">p</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.286108em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathit">x</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">v</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15139200000000003em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.03588em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">p</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.286108em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">v</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15139200000000003em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.03588em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">p</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.286108em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mord mathrm">1</span></span></span></span>".</p>
