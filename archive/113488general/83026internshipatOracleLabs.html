<p>I just posted this message on the Lean-user mailing list:</p>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I am sharing the following information from Jean-Baptiste Tristan:</p>
<hr>
<p>My name is Jean-Baptiste Tristan, I am a researcher in the machine<br>
learning research group at Oracle Labs, located in the Boston area. I<br>
am looking for an intern who would be interested in doing work at the<br>
intersection of learning theory and formal verification.</p>
<p>More specifically, we would attempt to formalize one or more<br>
fundamental results from learning theory using the Coq proof<br>
assistant. This would require formalizing concepts from probably<br>
approximately correct learning. We would then attempt to prove one of<br>
the key theorems in learning theory such as the one that links finite<br>
VC dimensions with PAC learnability or the one on boosting that shows<br>
that weak learners can be boosted into strong learners. Such work<br>
would build the foundations toward accountable machine learning<br>
algorithms where we can offer strong formal guarantees that a machine<br>
learning algorithm is behaving as advertised.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate if you could share this short proposal with<br>
your students, and I would be happy to answer more questions.</p>
<hr>
<p>This could be a summer internship for a PhD student, but the terms are flexible. Jean-Baptiste tells me that he has been considering Coq in part because of the existence of the MLCert project (<a href="http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/mlcert.html" target="_blank" title="http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/mlcert.html">http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/mlcert.html</a>), but he is open to considering alternatives, like Lean.</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can e-mail him directly:</p>
<p>Jean-Baptiste Tristan &lt;<a href="mailto:JEAN.BAPTISTE.TRISTAN@oracle.com" title="mailto:JEAN.BAPTISTE.TRISTAN@oracle.com">JEAN.BAPTISTE.TRISTAN@oracle.com</a>&gt; </p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>
