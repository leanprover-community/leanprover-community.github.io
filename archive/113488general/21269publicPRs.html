<p>I'd like to introduce a slight change in PR management on mathlib. In order to support third party contribution to PRs, I would like to introduce "PR branches" to mathlib. The basic idea is, if there is a PR that is currently in review, for which you are not the author, and you would like to help get it into mathlib, just ask to have it made public on the PR page, and I will add it as a branch on the mathlib repo. This way, if a PR is stalled, you can get it back on track. I think this will make collaboration on WIPs easier, although it will probably confuse GitHub a bit, because of the way PR pages are set up. If you PR to a PR branch, make sure to reference the original PR # so that we can navigate between them through GitHub.</p>

<p>Would it be useful to have a separate account for those WIP? That way you can have a stricter separation between the PRs. The added benefit is that you may promote more maintainers for that account</p>

<p>You may or may not recall that mathlib was once <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/library_dev" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/library_dev">https://github.com/leanprover/library_dev</a> . When we first moved from library_dev to mathlib, the idea was that library_dev might contain more experimental stuff or stuff that doesn't quite compile, but that never really happened</p>

<p>I vaguely remember. I think a PR account might have to refrain from having a master branch. It would really be only a waiting room for big PRs</p>

<p>well, if it's a fork of mathlib then it will have a master branch, that is just tracking mathlib</p>

<p>I'm liking the idea so far. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> What do you think about this? I can create a <code>lean-sandbox</code> user account, fork mathlib, and just give write access to anyone who wants it. People can still use the PR system on the sandbox account if they want, or create branches and PR them to mathlib.</p>

<p>I recently created <code>https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-mode-contrib</code> to host community contributions to <code>lean-mode</code>. It could double as a home for mathlib PRs</p>

<p>Not quite. I thought I'd make it a mode that adds to <code>lean-mode</code>. I'm replicating some functionalities from <code>company-coq</code>. And now that the repo exists, I think I'll start adding some of my own scripts (like shortcuts for adding common libraries to your leanpkg.toml file).</p>

<p>I am inspired in part by metamath's "mathbox" infrastructure, although in that case the mathboxes are required to compile at all times but are otherwise organized at the discretion of the user</p>

<p>In principle, the maintainers will have to accept pull requests too. That's why I would err towards more maintainers rather than fewer. </p>

<p>I don't really understand this proposal (that's not some implied criticism -- I just actually mean I don't understand it). I've just looked through the perfectoid <code>for_mathlib</code> directory and I see stuff I wrote and then forgot about, stuff which would be trivial to PR into mathlib, stuff which I half-wrote (quotient rings) and then someone else wrote better and which might already have been PR'ed -- after our discussion yesterday I'm wondering whether actually it might introduce some kind of order into the system if some of the really basic stuff like quotient additive groups and quotient rings should get into mathlib ASAP (indeed some of it might be there already). One thing I certainly don't want is for us to end up in the situation where people are relying on me to do things, as I already have far too much to do. As you know Mario I have started making tiny mathlib PRs, just dipping my toe in as it were; the stuff I put in "for_mathlib" myself is just stuff which I feel like it would be too much effort for me to PR into mathlib. On the other hand I'm coming round to the idea that perhaps  working from the bottom up is actually a good idea (rather than what we're currently doing, which is working top down, bottom up and in the middle all at once). </p>
<p>I think the problem I currently have with the mathlib set-up (which is I think why I started the "for-mathlib" directory) is the following. Let's say I realise I need 50 lines of code about e.g. topological groups, which is not in mathlib, but which would very naturally live in an existing mathlib file, e.g. <code>analysis/topology/topological_structures.lean</code>. The thing is, I want them <em>now</em>. I could either edit <code>topological_structure.lean</code> and make a PR, which would take me a long time because mathlib has conventions I don't know about or don't understand, and then there would be some to-ing and fro-ing whilst people told me that I've proved this lemma in a stupid way, and that lemma is just <code>by simp</code>, and that lemma is already there, and that lemma never uses inverses so it should really be in the topological monoid section -- and then I have to find time to edit everything etc etc to try and fix it up -- and this process can easily go on for weeks. During that time I find it really hard to actually access my own work, because it is "in limbo" -- it's not in mathlib and so it's not in my project. It's <em>much</em> easier just to write <code>for_mathlib/topological_structures.lean</code> and prove the lemmas I want, with their bad names and bad proofs and superfluous hypotheses, because then I can start using them immediately, because I'm not really interested in these lemmas anyway, I'm far more interested in doing the "meat" which is the perfectoid spaces, and in some sense I just want someone else to prove these basic facts about topological groups, someone who knows what they're doing and will do it right the first time. Unfortunately the set of such people is pretty small and they all have their own things that they're doing. I'm not motivated to PR, because of this. </p>
<p>Will the proposed system offer some sort of alternative approach which gets me out of this hole?</p>

<p>I am fully aware of this situation, I often have to deal with it myself. The solution I came up with for this is to have a <code>pending</code> directory or file, which serves basically the same purpose as your <code>for_mathlib</code>. The difference is that I PR <em>first</em>, and then put something as close as possible to my PR into this pending area during the review period. That way, once the PR is accepted all I have to do is delete the relevant portion from the pending area.</p>

<p>I see. So basically you're saying that I'm doing it wrong, and I am beginning to learn from my own experience that the "code now, PR later" approach has its disadvantages (e.g. I think that my partially written quotient ring code might be obsolete -- did Chris PR this? I still struggle with quotients; I have <code>a ≈ 0↔ ⟦a⟧ = ⟦0⟧ : by sorry</code> in my code at some point). I think it's far easier (for me at least) to understand other people when they say "do it my way not your way", once I've begun to realise the disadvantages of my way.</p>

<p>I'm not saying you have to PR everything as soon as it is written. But once you decide you have something you want to get into mathlib, it moves from where it currently is, probably some random file in your project, to the <code>for_mathlib</code> area and also into a PR, possibly [WIP]. Then you get feedback on your stuff, and if you make any updates to the PR you can either copy them to your local version or just leave the pending area out of date and update later (if you think it will affect your project I would recommend you update sooner rather than later).</p>

<p>I think it's far easier (for me at least) to understand other people when they say "do it my way not your way", once I've begun to realise the disadvantages of my way.</p>

<p>I know I have a bad habit of asking people to "do it my way not your way", but I try to explain what the major issues are. The main problem is that making bad design decisions can be very expensive time-wise, without even alerting you to the possibility that the cost is avoidable. So when I hear that you've been struggling with an issue for several months and just working around it, my heart goes out to you and I wish I could have saved you from that.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib">shared mathlib fork</a> doesn't seem to add much benefit over any other mathlib fork. You could easily use your own. It really is just a bit more convenient is that it has an established “trusted” set of collaborators, so that anyone in that group can contribute to anyone else's work. But if you want to work with only a different set of collaborators, you can also set up your own fork. But it's also a bit more questionable in that there's no clear policy for who does what with what branches, which can cause problems if people have different assumptions or don't communicate changes to each other.</p>

<p>I think I'd do this differently. Instead of a mathlib fork, I'd suggest a sort of mathlib nursery, which is a library that has mathlib as a dependency. The collaborators would be set up as they are now, but the library source would be initially empty and added to by anyone on the <code>master</code> branch. Then, everybody moves WIP stuff into the mathlib-nursery. Once somebody's happy with part of their work, they can get feedback from others and somebody can PR that to mathlib. When the PR makes it into mathlib, the mathlib dependency commit is updated and the work is removed from mathlib-nursery.</p>

<p>For offshoot projects and experiments, a separate project is maybe nicer to work with, although you lose the ability to modify bits of mathlib to accomodate the work</p>

<p>Yeah, agreed. I think it would be nice to have a community-based nursery for stuff not ready for PR.</p>

<p>So, there could be a staged process:</p>
<p>1. throw it in the nursery, let other people use it or work on it<br>
2. when matured, create a community mathlib PR for it</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110045">@Sean Leather</span> I like the idea of a nursery. It makes it easier to get features used faster.

<p>One minimal requirement that I would have and would state on the <code>README.md</code> is that the code should build successfully for a given commit of mathlib and Lean version and not have any <code>sorry</code>s. I don't think it's an issue if the code changes significantly over time, but it's a pain for others if it doesn't build.</p>
