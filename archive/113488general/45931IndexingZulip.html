<p>At the meeting in Amsterdam, someone raised the question of archiving the Zulip chat and making it accessible to search engines. It's hard to find answers to Lean questions online right now. You have to register and search here specifically. </p>
<p>I wrote a little script that will scrape the public streams here and post them to an openly accessible site. You can see a sample here: <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive">https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive</a></p>
<p>Before I spend more time on this, I wanted to check with people -- are there any objections on privacy grounds? I'm displaying strictly less information than is available openly to anyone who registers for Zulip -- no email addresses, no pictures. To me it seems comparable to the archive of an email list, which is often public and indexed. </p>
<p>If there are no objections, I'll finish the script and put up a whole archive. New posts will be added every time the script runs. I don't have a reliable server to automate this; my plan was just to run the script when I think about it, since there's nothing time sensitive, but if anyone has a better plan I'm listening. I also don't have the time to waste on web design. So if anyone wants to mess with the css, Jekyll setup, etc, let's talk.</p>

<p>This is a good interim step, but I'll repeat what I said in Amsterdam: I think that stackexchange  is an extremely good framework for recording questions and answers, and I would like to see these kind of things move either to stackoverflow (where there are currently about 3000 questions on coq and/or isabelle, and 48 on lean) or to a new site focused on proof assistants.</p>

<p>I think this chat serves a more general purpose than Stack Overflow. There's lots of general discussion here that doesn't really happen in that format. Trying to direct questions that way and discussions this way would be counterproductive. Of course, I don't want to discourage SO use either, I've answered a few questions there when they've shown up.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130308">@Neil Strickland</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> one potential compromise is to ask post-hoc questions on SE!

<p>I've made some progress here. There's a full archive of this chat, as of some time earlier today: <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/">https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/</a></p>
<p>You guys like to use Zulip in ways that don't play well with Jekyll. There are a few outstanding issues:<br>
- Lean syntax highlighting. This is a pipeline issue: there's a PR to Rouge that needs to be merged, and then Github needs to update.<br>
- Parsing urls. Zulip's markdown parser is different from the options in Jekyll, which will only convert urls to links if they're enclosed in &lt; &gt;. Oh well, I'm not going to fix this.<br>
- Malformed posts. Some of you like to write posts that end with code blocks and leave off the closing backticks (<a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/invalid%20%27calc%27%3A%20transitivity%20rule/near/125130159" title="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/invalid%20%27calc%27%3A%20transitivity%20rule/near/125130159">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/invalid%20%27calc%27%3A%20transitivity%20rule/near/125130159</a>), which leads to this: <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/113488general/90773invalidcalctransitivityrule.html" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/113488general/90773invalidcalctransitivityrule.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/113488general/90773invalidcalctransitivityrule.html</a> I'm not sure what to do here.</p>
<p>It's possible to let Zulip process the markdown instead, but then I need to write css to match it's output, and I hate writing css.</p>

<p>On each stream page, there should be a divider between the stream name and the list of topics. Otherwise the stream name itself is indistinguishable from the topics, and clicking on it mysteriously does nothing. (Different styling could solve this.)</p>

<p><del>It might be nice, on each topic, to include a link directly to that topic on zulip. (Just in case people land on the searchable archive page from a search, and want to continue the discussion.)</del></p>
<p>I see now that the heading of each message is actually a link to that message on zulip. This is probably sufficient. Perhaps ideal would be to instead display the little zulip "Z" icon next to the message heading, and just link that? Then it's clear without reading the URL what clicking will do.</p>

<p>I couldn't make Jekyll linkify urls, and the alternative is writing something in Python to identify them and enclose them in &lt;&gt; (but not when they're already part of markdown links). It's possible, I guess, but not a priority.</p>

<p>The way you display quotations puts everything into fixed-width font. It's slightly confusing (because it looks like a code block), but not that important.

<p>Quotes prefixed with <code>&gt;</code> get parsed differently (and displayed better) than ones in backticks. Probably fixable once I have the time and will to dive into the css.</p>

<p>Thank you very much Rob! I'm not sure it's a good idea to include all streams in this archive, because it clutters the main list. I think only general, maths and new members should be there. Or do you think people will only get there through Google, hence it doesn't matter?</p>

<p>I think there's interesting discussion that goes on in PR reviews, Lean Together 2019, etc. And there could be new channels in the future worth indexing. Maybe we should blacklist rss and travis instead of whitelisting general, math, and new members.</p>

<p>Another thing we might think about putting on the leanprover-community website is a version of the lean web editor that uses a current build of mathlib / lean. I'd want to figure out why the emscripten builds of lean don't work in Firefox is before really pursuing this though.</p>

<p>I've made all the suggested changes that were easy. The latest addition added little Zulip icons next to the links to posts, but the Jekyll build on GitHub is timing out now. Not sure if that's a result of this change or what. I'll restart it in a bit.</p>

<p>For some reason, adding little Zulip icons in the markdown makes the Github build time out. It only adds about 5% locally. I added them with css, which is way better anyway.</p>

<p>Good question. I assumed it was by time of creation, newest first, since Lean Together is at the top. But that doesn't look right. The Zulip API docs imply it's by stream id, lowest first, but that's also wrong.</p>

<p>I spent a bit more time today playing with this. It turns out, letting Zulip process the markdown solves some of the problems from before. No more formatting problems when people forget closing backticks, automatic linkification, quote formatting is more uniform.</p>

<p>That will always link to Zulip.

<p>It's a static site built with Jekyll and hosted using GitHub Pages. As far as I can tell you don't have much control over how to direct arbitrary urls like that. Maybe there's a way, but my Google skills failed to find it.</p>

<p>!! I stumbled upon the indexer from a HN thread (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19473134" target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19473134">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19473134</a>). The rust-lang community (<a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com" target="_blank" title="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com">https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com</a>) has been looking for exactly this public archive, so I was trying to reuse the tool. Yesterday I tried it on <a href="http://chat.zulip.org" target="_blank" title="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a> for the initial full-mirroring, which took ~45 min, but had to subsequently <code>mkdir</code> several directories and included several of the asset files. I think it would be super helpful to have the mirror script put in a separate repository that can be readily used by other projects.</p>

<p>The mirror script was mostly hacked together over the course of a couple train rides. As you noticed, it's not very polished! It's been on my to-do list for a while to clean up the script and make it independent of the rest of the repository. But more immediate things keep getting in the way. I haven't had a long train ride in a couple months, heh.</p>

<p>I'm guessing you had to <code>mkdir</code> the <code>_json</code> and <code>archive</code> directories and create the file where it tracks the time of the last update?</p>

<p>Yeah, for more context, there was a prior art (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/8135" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/8135">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/8135</a>) but it was very complex and in the end, it didn't come through, and it was thought to be a tough project.</p>
<p>I'd say the remaining things to do should take about an hour or two.<br>
Indeed, the empty dirs that have to exist prior to the start of the script are: <code>archive</code>, <code>_json</code>, <code>_includes</code> (the last one is for archive_update.html, i.e. the time tracking).  I haven't checked about the assets (svgs etc) that have to be included though.</p>

<p>That PR (or at least the linked proposal) is trying to do a lot more than my little script. I definitely do want to clean it when I have time. You're right that the directories issue needs to be fixed, and it can be factored out from the rest of the repo somewhat.</p>
