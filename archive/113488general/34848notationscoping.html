<p>This is exactly how lean 2 notation used to work. Why it changed, I don't know, and I'm not clear on whether to expect this to be different in lean 4.<br>
I think that lean 3 notation is not handled very well at all, this is why I avoid all notation overloading in mathlib</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lean 2 used the notion of "metaclasses" to scope notations, coercions, and attributes declared in namespaces. To use them, you had <code>open</code> the namespace, either with an explicit list of metaclasses, or with all of them as the default. It was annoying and didn't make any sense for most of the metaclasses - except perhaps for notations and <code>classical.prop_decidable</code>. We completely removed metaclasses for Lean 3.<br>
I'm open to proposals for a notation (and macro) scoping system in Lean 4. A survey of designs in other systems would probably be a good first step.</p>

<p>for reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interpretation scopes<br>
An interpretation scope is a set of notations for terms with their interpretation. Interpretation scopes provide a weak, purely syntactical form of notations overloading: the same notation, for instance the infix symbol + can be used to denote distinct definitions of the additive operator. Depending on which interpretation scopes is currently open, the interpretation is different. Interpretation scopes can include an interpretation for numerals and strings. However, this is only made possible at the Objective Caml level.</p>
<p>See Figure 12.1 for the syntax of notations including the possibility to declare them in a given scope. Here is a typical example which declares the notation for conjunction in the scope type_scope.</p>
<p>Notation “A /\ B” := (and A B) : type_scope.<br>
Note</p>
<p>A notation not defined in a scope is called a lonely notation.</p>
<p>Global interpretation rules for notations<br>
At any time, the interpretation of a notation for term is done within a stack of interpretation scopes and lonely notations. In case a notation has several interpretations, the actual interpretation is the one defined by (or in) the more recently declared (or open) lonely notation (or interpretation scope) which defines this notation. Typically if a given notation is defined in some scope scope but has also an interpretation not assigned to a scope, then, if scope is open before the lonely interpretation is declared, then the lonely interpretation is used (and this is the case even if the interpretation of the notation in scope is given after the lonely interpretation: otherwise said, only the order of lonely interpretations and opening of scopes matters, and not the declaration of interpretations within a scope).</p>
<p>The initial state of Coq declares three interpretation scopes and no lonely notations. These scopes, in opening order, are core_scope, type_scope and nat_scope.</p>

<p>would be nice since we have leanpkg that there would be some idea of "package-scope". then my notations, type-class instances, &amp;such have precedence when inside my package.</p>

<p>It's not quite about <code>a .+ b</code>, but more how should lean handle cases where people use notation to mean different things. consider if one person wants <code>sin^2 x</code> to be <code>(sin x)^2</code>, but another person wants it to mean <code>sin (sin x)</code>. They define that notation in their own files and for whatever reason you end up importing both of them.  Which one should win?</p>

<p>I'm not intimately familiar with the Coq notation given above, but it sounds complicated and confusing. I would like to see notation and non-notation name scopes be treated similarly and simply by <code>open</code>, probably more like of Agda. (But I'm sure my familiarity breeds bias.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110025">@Andrew Ashworth</span> Maybe we're thinking from different sides of the same coin? It sounds you want a given global name-/notation-space with the ability to restrict it.

<p>As a general comment, much of Coq's notation complexity seems to stem from the fact that it does not support notation overloading (i.e. overlapping notation disambiguated at elaboration time). Is that correct?</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/syntax-declarations.html" target="_blank" title="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/syntax-declarations.html">Agda syntax declarations</a>, but I was thinking mainly about the power and flexibility of Agda's <code>open</code> for modules. Since you can use nearly arbitrary Unicode naming structure (cf. mixfix parsing) in Agda, most of what is notation in Lean are names in Agda. Thus, they are treated by <code>open</code> in the same way as ASCII names are.</p>

<p><code>hide</code> currently only works for <code>open</code>ed or <code>export</code>ed names, I think. Perhaps that could be lifted. For specifying overloaded notations, you'd need to know their macro names. I'm not sure what the autogenerated names would look like, probably similar to <code>instance</code>.</p>

<p>Sure, they are already implemented via <code>notation</code> in Lean 3 anyway</p>

<p>Cool! And, while you're at it, point notation? In the same vein as we discussed in the past? <span class="emoji emoji-1f609" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>

<p>The namespace field projection stuff.</p>

<p>Basically, I think you could consider field notation as a special notation that could become more flexible than right now.</p>

<p>I haven't seen a very convincing example for generalizing projection notation outside of the original namespace yet. It may be simple to implement it yourself when the elaborator is implemented in Lean, but currently I'm not anticipating that to happen in the first version of Lean 4. On the other hand, we're definitely planning to rewrite the pretty printer in Lean, so adding dot notation support during that sound good to me.</p>

<p>Dot-notation pretty-printing is a good step. But I don't think I'd want everything that could be pretty-printed with that notation to be done in that way. Do you?</p>

<p>No, I think there should be an option with values "none/attributed/all"</p>

<p>A global <code>set_option</code> option? I was thinking it would be preferable to decide for each identifier. What do each of the values mean?</p>

<p>"none": never pretty-print projection notation<br>
"attributed": use on identifiers attributed with some new attribute<br>
"all": use where possible</p>

<p>So I agree with you that there should be an attribute, but there should also be a quick way to turn it off completely</p>

<p>Sure, that sounds reasonable.</p>
