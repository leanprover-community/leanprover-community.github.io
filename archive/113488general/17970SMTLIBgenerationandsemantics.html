<p>Is there a library for representing and rendering SMTLIB 2 expressions that is compatible with Lean 3?  I'd like to have a library where I can generate SMTLIB (specifically the uninterpreted functions/sorts, bitvectors, and arrays), and express semantically what it means for a set of SMTLIB assertions to be satisfiable from a model-theoretic definition.  I can start one, but don't want to duplicate existing work.</p>

<p>We have <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/smt2_interface" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/smt2_interface">https://github.com/leanprover/smt2_interface</a>. It should still work, hopefully</p>

<p>Thanks, it looks like this has most of what I'd want.  Is this intended to be ported to be compatible with Lean4?  I'd like to also define a model theory for SMTLIB.  Is that something that you think would be welcome in this repo?</p>

<p>I don't think we have any specific plans for this package, but hopefully it should be quick to port. I don't have any specific thoughts about what should go in the package either, but perhaps it could be a separate package on top of smt2_interface?</p>
