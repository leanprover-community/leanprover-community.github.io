<p>Has anyone got LiveShare working with Lean and mathlib? I just tried it with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="202902">@Anca Ciobanu</span> ; firstly she shared a session but had a .gitignore file containing things like _target, and when the session was shared her code compiled for her but not for me -- all the imports failed. We renamed her .gitignore and tried again, and this time I see her _target and also her leanpkg.path, all of which looks perfect (coincidentally, she is on a different OS so it couild have been random) but still my VS Code cannot pick up the imports. What are we doing wrong?</p>

<p>The sharing is working, it's just that her code compiles for her and not for me.</p>

<p>I mean, you can both edit the same file, but the client will not see any meaningful feedback from the server</p>

<p>The problem is just that in VS Code, it shows you those files that exist on the hosts machine</p>

<p>but they do not actually exist on your computer anywhere in the filesystem</p>

<p>so the external Lean command has nothing to work on</p>
