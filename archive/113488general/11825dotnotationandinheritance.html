<p>I find dot notation extremely useful. However, it has some shortcomings. I would like to know if there are ways to avoid them, or if I will have to live with them. Here is a basic example, with a simple class <code>basic</code>, and another class <code>extended</code> that extends it. If <code>basic</code> has a field <code>n</code>, then <code>a.n</code> works for <code>a : basic</code>, and <code>b.n</code> works for <code>b : extended</code> (I guess by some parser trickery) but it is displayed as <code>b.to_basic.n</code> in a proof state (in tactic mode). Let me know define a function <code>basic.foo</code> doing whatever. Then <code>a.foo</code> works, as well as <code>b.to_basic.foo</code>, but <code>b.foo</code> doesn't (because the parser (?) is looking for a function <code>extended.foo</code> as <code>b</code> has type extended).</p>

<p>In python, there is a mechanism by which, if a class doesn't have some attribute, then the system will look for the attribute in classes it inherits from. So, in the above example, it would find <code>b.foo</code>. I have two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>is there a way to make this work in Lean?</li>
<li>In the proof state, is there a way to display <code>b.n</code> instead of <code>b.to_basic.n</code>?</li>
</ul>
<p>A positive answer to any of these questions would improve the situation a lot for me, as proofs with nested structures become very messy otherwise. This is all for new style structures, by the way.</p>

<p>I don't think there is a good structured way to do this. </p>
<p>A hackish way that might help a bit with (2): you could do something like <code>local postfix </code>↟<code>:max := extended.to_basic</code>.</p>

<p>A related issue is that <code>group_hom.map_mul</code>doesn't exist even though this is what a mathematician would guess it was called. I just want to make more fields to fix it but I am told by the CS guys that instead I have to write good docs</p>

<p>You don't need the namespace to exist, you can define the lemma <code>group_hom.map_mul</code> if you like.<br>
My issues are not reallyproblems I can't solve, but things that could be massively improved. Maybe in Lean 4. </p>
<p>The old structure command is not really a solution, as it means you need to restate all your lemmas in the new namespace. What I would like to avoid is code duplication, and clutter in the proofs.</p>

<p>Mathematicians want <code>group_hom.map_mul </code> because it's what it's called. I couldn't care less if the parser just ate <code>group_hom</code> and replaced it with <code>monoid_hom</code> -- as far as I am concerned these two tokens are syntactically equal but I want to be able to tell lean's pretty printer what I want to see because mathematicians simply do not care about monoids and it makes the software more intimidating</p>

<p>I agree that <code>is_group_hom.map_mul</code> should exist. What is the argument against it? We already have both <code>is_mul_hom.map_mul</code> and <code>is_monoid_hom.map_mul</code>. I understand that generally we don't want to state the same lemma twice, but for the sake of projection notation, it seems useful.</p>

<p>I don't understand what the problem with code duplication is. Who cares?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose I have developed a theory of <code>local_equiv</code>s (partially defined bijections), with 50 lemmas on how the source and target of a local equiv interact with composition, restriction, and so on. And then I want to build local homeomorphisms. With a new style structure, I need to write <code>e.to_local_equiv</code>everywhere. With the old style structure, I need to copy my 50 lemmas to the new setting. And then when I improve local equivs by adding a lemma, or changing the order of parameters, or renaming the lemmas, then I need to update also the local homeomorphisms file, as otherwise things are not coherent any more. In both cases, this is very frustrating.</p>
<p>I started with new style, then I got tired of all this <code>to_local_equiv</code>, so I switched to old style, but this is becoming a maintenance nightmare, so I am considering to move back to new style. Not to mention that I started without coercions, then I realized that coercions are used everywhere with respect to equivs, so I switched to coercions, but this is creating problems down the hill (coercions need the type to be fully elaborated, so I have to add a lot of annotations). So I am considering removing the coercions again... This is really hard to get right. After experimenting with everything, it seems that I will end with new style structure, and no coercion. Unless someone here convinces me to switch again :)</p>

<p>Sounds like we should add something to vscode so that autocomplete will work such that you could type foo.tle (key combination) and have it be expanded out to foo.to_local_equiv</p>

<p>Sounds like we should add something to the parser so that, if it sees <code>e.foo</code> for <code>e</code>of type <code>local_homeomorph</code> and there is no <code>local_homeomorph.foo</code>, then it goes down the line of inheritance for <code>local_homeomorph</code> (exploring the ancestors either breadth-first or depth first or something more complicated as in Python, I don't mind) looking for somehting named <code>foo</code> in one of these namespaces, and uses the first one it finds.</p>
<p>Except that "we" doesn't mean "me" because this is way above my league, so I don't see this done any time soon: people who could do it have more important things to do!</p>

<p>How about just <code>map_mul</code> instead of <code>group_hom.map_mul</code>? And the docstribg should mention it doesn't work for <code>semiring_hom</code>, which should be renamed <code>ring_hom</code></p>

<p>I am optimistic your wish can be fixed in Lean 4. If the parser is as extensible as claimed, we should be able to traverse the scope symbol tables as you describe (maybe, hopefully, disclaimer: haven't looked at lean 4 source).</p>
