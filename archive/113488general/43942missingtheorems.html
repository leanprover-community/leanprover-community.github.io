<p>I have noticed that there seems to be a mismatch between the theorems in the <code>set</code> and <code>finset</code> module in mathlib. I would expect them to share a lot of theorems (and indeed they do), but there are also theorems in one which are not in the other, when they might be expected to be in both.</p>
<p>For example, in <code>set</code> (in <code>data/set/basic.lean</code>) there is:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">theorem</span> <span class="n">union_diff_distrib</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">set</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="err">∪</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="err">\</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="err">\</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="err">∪</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="err">\</span> <span class="n">u</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However, there is no similarly typed theorem for <code>finset</code>.</p>
<p>Is there a reason for this?</p>

<p>I'm planning a PR to add this sort of thing soon, as far as I can tell it's just the case that no-one's gotten round to it yet</p>
