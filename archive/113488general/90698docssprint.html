<p>There have been several additions to mathlib recently, many people asking what is there, and Mario's talk giving an overview. I think it's a good time to put some energy into that <code>docs</code> directory. Let's try out new community fork on this: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/cc1f2c6a2a2c00c833d28023a63f9670f175d74d" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/cc1f2c6a2a2c00c833d28023a63f9670f175d74d">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/cc1f2c6a2a2c00c833d28023a63f9670f175d74d</a> is a starting point. Note that I added links to several files which existed but were not reachable from the README. I also added new files in theory, but they don't contain much yet.</p>

<p>I think it would also be useful to think of some common scheme for the <code>theories</code> directory. For instance: one short paragraph mentioning what is there and the main files. Then a highlights sections mentioning the main definitions and theorems (probably only the maths and Lean names, not copying the def). Then some maths discussion, as in the topological space doc (or Kevin's blog post), some more examples.</p>

<p>I agree. I've learnt a lot more about what is in mathlib recently. I feel like there should be a better way of documenting it.</p>

<p>Hey Patrick! Guess what I did just before I went to sleep yesterday: I wrote a two page todo-list of stuff that I wanted to see documented. I think a docs sprint is an awesome idea!</p>

<p>I'll see if I can find some time to add stuff. But it's holiday time over here. So I might not be very active the next few days.</p>

<p>I wrote my random blog posts because I was desperate at that time to find some way in to what was in mathlib, which at that time looked huge and daunting to me (and IIRC it might even have been before Mario went through and added docstrings to many of the major results). At that time, for example, I found <code>rat.lean</code> incomprehensible. Now things are very different -- for example I understand the "point" of a mathlib file now; to set up an API for the user so that someone like me can use multisets without having to worry about the fact that their definition is rather delicate so proving basic properties about them can be complicated. </p>
<p>So what form should these docs take? How about using the Wiki feature of github? One wiki page per directory perhaps? Pages don't attempt to document everything, but instead flag the names of the main theorems and main definitions. I still don't know too much about lattices, but I note that when giving other things the structure of a lattice, "sometimes &lt;= is defined to be &gt;=", as it were (I forgot the specific example where this happened but I think it happens at least once). </p>
<p>I don't think my approach with N,Z,Q etc of just writing down a bunch of random theorems and saying what their names are is a particularly good one. It helped me a lot at the time, but that was when I was struggling to work out the naming system.</p>
<p>What do people think about the Wiki idea? Perhaps I'll knock up a sample page and people can comment.</p>

<p>We already discuss the wiki option. The trouble is that Mario doesn't have enough power on the mathlib page to allow that. We could use the community account and link from official mathlib though. But using the public fork before PRing to mathlib is almost as easy. Remember you should have push access. So you can <code>git clone git@github.com:leanprover-community/mathlib.git</code>,<code>git checkout docs-theories</code>, commit there and push</p>

<p>While beginning this, I thought the file organization in mathlib probably needs some refactoring. In the mean time we cannot really use one page per directory. See the mess in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/docs-theories/docs/theories/polynomials.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/docs-theories/docs/theories/polynomials.md">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/docs-theories/docs/theories/polynomials.md</a> for instance</p>

<p>I'm writing up some personal notes based on the convo with Mario. its still quite idiosyncratic but I could spend some time making it a draft for some docs if that would be useful. But since I am still learning it might be best to let someone else who knows what they are doing make the first draft.</p>

<p>I'm not complaining, and I would love to read documentation by Ed. I'm only trying to get my answer (right now I'll go the beach, but I'd love to have an answer when I'll come back). Ed, you shouldn't wait for experts to write documentation if you can write some. All doc in mathlib was written by people who just learned it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Ed this is absolutely true. For example the docs on <code>simp</code> were written by me precisely because I knew nothing about <code>simp</code>. I asked some questions here, wrote some basic first draft, PR'ed it, people told me about the noob mistakes I'd made, I edited it, it became a basic doc with some basic facts about <code>simp</code> which aren't mentioned in Theorem Proving In Lean (TPIL), and now I sometimes point people to it when they ask basic <code>simp</code> questions. We're not trying to be professional -- we're just trying to get basic facts down which are "known to the experts" but for which there is no reference. I would strongly encourage you to just post your personal docs as a PR to somewhere in the <code>docs</code> directory of mathlib. Anything you write would be appreciated, because, as you've probably seen, what is available in PIL is very limited, and you're already way ahead of most of us with your questions.</p>

<p>So Patrick is suggesting that we just stick to writing <code>.md</code> files like before. Would a wiki not be a better way of organising the information? I guess the wiki stuff on github is just a bunch of <code>.md</code> files anyway...</p>

<p>I think it's not a big problem to have several ways of documenting stuff. What you wrote is more narrative and less of a quick access list</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anything to do with the mathematics: proving a theorem, writing a definition, defining an inductive type ... is called object-level or theory-level ([TODO] what is the preferred nomenclature here?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The usual term here is "object-level". But I think it is worth pointing out that <code>meta</code> in lean is a bit of a misnomer - it is more accurate to call this <code>unsafe</code>, because it enables a number of unsound mechanisms, and while it is useful for metaprogramming it is not exclusively used for this (not all metaprogramming things are <code>meta</code>, and not all <code>meta</code> things are used in metaprogramming)</p>

<p>Re the note on unification: so there are lots of different algorithms for unification. Does this mean that in principle one could have a conservative algorithm in the kernel, and other "user land" algorithms for unification as tactics or so?</p>

<p>Maybe you're right. I still learning all these things, and I'm a complete novice... but I guess there is some sort of "default" algorithm. Anyway, if it's not in the kernel, then it is probably possible to have different unification algorithms that coexist.</p>

<p>Unification is not done in the kernel. It used to be in the kernel. Although I didn't find the precise C++ file that <em>is</em> doing unification.</p>

<p>The trouble is that there are lots of 'expansion packs' you can add to unification and they are all munged together in the literature. The most basic form of unification just does structural equality while assigning metavariables when it needs to. Then there is (undecidable in general) higher-order unification that tries to guess metavariables which are functions. There is also unification up to definitional equality and even unification where the unifier will perform rewrites using certain rules in the environment. I am not sure which of these Lean is doing, I find it hard to inspect in the source code. On top of this the unifier in Lean treats typeclass instances differently to other unification constraints.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it is worth trying to figure this out because:<br>
- Lean usually unifies/matches things sensibly anyway, so the implementation details can usually be ignored in practice.<br>
- I would guess that the details of the unifier are going to change in Lean 4 anyway</p>

<p>Ok... so my TODO list for the docs sprint is now becoming very short... I wanted to push myself to write down some sort of summary of what I understood about <code>meta</code> and document everything that I learned from Ed's question barrage. But now he did that himself... I also wanted to document some of the maths in mathlib, but Kevin already wrote down a thorough overview. So, what is left is a small section on how to contribute to mathlib: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/docs-theories/docs/howto-contribute.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/docs-theories/docs/howto-contribute.md">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/docs-theories/docs/howto-contribute.md</a></p>

<p>I think those early files I wrote are pretty rubbish and I think there's an argument which says that that whole part of the docs should be re-thought. I wrote those files when I was just figuring out what mathlib was, and my understanding was very superficial.</p>

<p>It seems to me that one of the most common questions about mathlib, from mathematicians at least, is "is X in mathlib?". But X is hardly ever "rings" (and I think that pointing someone who asks this to <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/theories/rings_fields.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/theories/rings_fields.md">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/theories/rings_fields.md</a> is a bit daft when we could just say "yes"), and it's never "commutative distribs" or whatever. More and more often it's things like "topological groups" or "Noetherian rings" or "fundamental groups" or "linear maps" or something -- and perhaps this part of the docs should be an attempt to answer such questions. Related questions are stuff like "how much number theory is in Lean"? Maybe we should be thinking more about writing really good answers to these questions.</p>
