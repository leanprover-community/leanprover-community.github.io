<p>There are many systems that allow you to write and check proofs written in a formal language. Lean, Metamath, Isabelle HOL, Coq, ACL2, Agda, Albatross, F*, HOL Light, HOL4, LEGO, Mizar, NuPRL, PVS, Twelf</p>
<p>I'm just wondering if we are better or worse off having all these different systems. Should we all just stick to one and build a good library in it, or is there some fundamental reasons why one is better than another. Yes, Lean has a computational component that Metamath doesn't, but nothing is stopping you from writing a model of a real computer in Metamath. Yes, Lean has proof automation that Metamath doesn't have, but aren't big general  theorems exactly the same as proof automation? I'd personally be especially interested in hearing <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> s thoughts on this. Pondering this I'm reminded of  a song called "One Vision" by Queen..</p>

<p>I am largely agnostic as to foundations. But I do think that we should make every effort to connect all the proof systems together, because how else can we make proofs "stick"? It would be quite the nightmare if we can never get off the ground because we reinvent natural number addition every five years in a new system</p>

<p>Actually, I prefer simple foundations to complex ones because the complex foundations fool you into thinking that you have something that is easier than it is; as soon as you stray from what the axioms give you things become hard again</p>

<p>The most important feature a foundation has is <em>expressivity</em>, the ability to define the things people care about, with proportional overhead (not exponential overhead!). If you can't write X in the system, then you are doomed, although you can delay the inevitable for a while</p>

<p>The problem with questions like that is it presupposes that Metamath and Lean are trying to solve the same problems, and they aren't</p>

<p>Metamath is a logical foundation and a verification system. It has a "build your own" user experience</p>

<p>Of course you want tactics and a nice user experience, but I think metamath is one of the few systems that conciously separates this from the verification aspect</p>

<p>I'm just wondering whether there is any fundamental reason why writing general theorems in metamath in order to help proving things is any different from writing tactics in Lean?</p>

<p>Theorems and tactics are different. A tactic is more like a metatheorem, a family of related theorems that are all provable</p>

<p>the downside of a tactic is that you have to run it every time you want a new proof, whereas you can check a theorem once and use it as many times as you like</p>

<p>I'm not an expert on this so please correct me if I'm completely wrong, but doesn't expressive foundations allow you to write category theory kinds of general theorems that are basically the same thing as tactics? I'm just guessing.</p>

<p>So the problem is that you can't make the metamath proof checker do complex calculations? You have to spell out the calculations in the proof? and then you need to have a metasystem that writes those long calculations?</p>

<p>So there is no way to make metamath proof checker perform an arbitrary calculation by writing down the definition of the calculation as a turing machine and proving that the calculation terminates? Because if you could, couldn't you somehow transfer the calculation work on to the proof checker side? that is make a tactic that's written inside the system?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Of course the problem with this is that everyone thinks that everybody else should be using their system. It also all depends on what your goals are.</p>
<p>The work of Rob Lewis and his collaborators, and the perfectoid project, are attempts to prove that Lean is capable of doing modern mathematics which "proper mathematicians" are interested in (this is a tongue-in-cheek phrase referring to people doing stuff like number theory/algebra/analysis/geometry etc in maths departments, as opposed to all the category theory / type theory people working on foundations). Sebastian Gouezel has produced work in Isabelle/HOL which is also mainstream mathematics done in a theorem prover. But we are in the minority here -- most work done in these systems is not an attempt to do modern mathematics on a computer. For example my impression is that Agda is a fascinating experiment to see what kinds of fancy inductive-recursive-inductive types one can get away with whilst preserving soundness. That's great, but guess what? The perfectoid project <em>does not contain one single instance of the <code>inductive</code> command</em>. Us "proper mathematicians" just need structures. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>or is there some fundamental reasons why one is better than another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People can certainly argue about this point all day. I think that dependent type theory is currently our best option for "all of pure mathematics" and I think that Lean is currently our best option for dependent type theory, but plenty of people have plenty of other opinions. The reason I like my opinion best is that I am one of few "proper mathematicians" who is even in a position to have an opinion, and when I hear other people talking about what they think mathematics is and how it fits best into their systems, I often find that the underlying disagreement is actually the question of what mathematics <em>is</em>. I am attempting to represent the generic pure mathematician who works in a generic mathematics department. </p>
<p>As is the case for programming languages in general, the best tool for the job depends very heavily on what the job is. An analogue of your question might be "I'm just wondering if we are better of worse off having all these different programming languages -- C, Rust, Java, Python, x86 assembly. Should we all just stick to one?"</p>

<p>To me, as someone who isn't that knowledgeable of foundational systems, it seems like a pretty practical way to describe a foundational system would be a list of axtioms that state that a computer program terminates. The lengths of various proofs and relative (between theorems) performance of the checker would be determined by which axioms you add. You could make a checker that both runs a computation to check for the proof and at the same time searches for proofs that the computation terminates so as to not have to do the computation. And I guess you can also describe the axiomatic content this way as well.</p>

<p>I have a related question about foundations and how they play with different proof systems.</p>
<p>I've been reading about topos theory lately, which I understand in some ways is an alternative foundations for mathematics, where there's a clearer distinction between the types of foundational assumptions we make.</p>
<p>This may sound hilarious to the mathematicians, but as a programmer I think of it as being a foundation with built-in axiomatic/foundational polymorphism, in the sense that I can define mathematical objects like the real numbers that are independent of the topos I work in, so by delaying the choice of topos that restricts the type of things I can say, I get a nicer organization of theorems based on the types of assumptions that have been made.</p>
<p>So to my naive understanding, it feels like doing math in topos theory is analogous to following good software engineering practices in maintaining a large code base. Is this a valid comparison?</p>
<p>If so, does the choice of foundations between something like Metamath/STT/DTT make a difference in working towards a goal like this?</p>

<p>If you need to add axioms to make a proof check faster (by more than a constant additive factor), then the prover is not expressive enough</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Note that Metamath does not belong on that list - it is not a mathematical foundation, it is an environment that lets you define your mathematical foundation. Isabelle has a similar distinction, if you are familiar with the difference between Isabelle/Pure vs Isabelle/HOL.</p>
<p>Most formal systems let you pick your axioms, although lean doesn't really let you turn off a great deal of axioms that you might not want (like universes or proof irrelevance). To me, your topos theory example is similar to proving theorems with attention paid to the axioms you use. In metamath this is easy because the axioms are quite fine grained - there are 30 or so of them, leading to 2^30 different subsystems of ZFC you could study; or just forget ZFC and add your own axioms if you prefer something else. Lean has only 3 axioms, and the only really useful one to avoid is <code>choice</code>, so reverse mathematics is a non-starter.</p>

<p>For my example with topos theory, let's say I make a definition that works in any elementary topos, and then I define a new topos, I can do this in independent order, and as soon as I'm done I should get a bunch of free theorems. If one was working in Metamath, then it feels like you'd have to be working one level higher, where the free theorems get automatically generated, does this sound correct?</p>

<p>What you don't get with this kind of embedding is the ability to reinterpret symbols. For example, if I prove a fact like <code>foo = foo</code> where <code>foo</code> is a "fixed constant" about which I know nothing, I cannot apply it with <code>foo := 2</code>. I can add an axiom saying <code>foo = 2</code>, and then <code>foo</code> acts like a definition, but I can't also add a definition <code>foo = 3</code> because that would be inconsistent</p>

<p>When I say higher level proof language, I mean a language that generates proofs that have a lot of repetition. The way Metamath allows you to inspect proofs down to very low level of detail is very nice, but the issue I have in mind is that if I write a definition in this higher level language, then the best way to understand its meaning is by reading it at this level, because we want to hide the repetition to increase the signal/noise ratio.

<p>Metamath is actually very non-repetitive, MM0 even more so. It would be nice to have some theorems about this, but they are pretty close to optimal. The repetition you see in the web page presentation is because each line is independent of the others, and common subterms are expanded during printing. In the actual proof it's totally deduplicated</p>

<p>I don't know what Lawvere's Fixpoint Theorem is, but I'm 100% confident you can state it as a single theorem of MM/MM0. If you want to apply it in a particular circumstance, you prove that your category instantiates the assumptions, unfold the meaning of the symbols (i.e. maybe you want to replace "generic morphism" with "function") in the statement, and that's it.</p>

<p>the considerations are roughly the same if you wanted to do the same thing in lean. Declare the general concept of a category, do your work there, then instantiate the theory in the concrete case</p>

<p>Lean is actually far more repetitive than Metamath. This is the result of things like tactics that don't clean up after themselves in the output proof, <code>congr</code> generating congr lemmas from scratch every time it's called, typeclass inference not saving and reusing typeclass lookups, and kernel <code>rfl</code> proofs, which have to unfold huge equation compiler terms</p>

<p>Metamath looks more repetitive because of its print settings, but exactly because of that people have a much greater incentive to minimize repetition. In other theorem provers all the junk is hidden under the rug</p>

<p>of course, your Lean server recompiles every time more than 200ms elapses between keystrokes, and while ideally you don't notice this because of caching, it's not hard for users to get to a place where they experience significant lag waiting on elaboration, typeclass resolution, and tactic execution</p>

<p>I think the larger issue I am trying to understand is if there is a way for me to see what are some examples of theorems/definitions that have very high generality (such as LFPT) simply by looking at the shape of the set of proof derivations in the database of theorems I'm working in (so probably <code>set.mm</code> in Metamath)</p>

<p>To give a simple example of why foundations don't matter, suppose I rewrote the lean kernel to produce typechecking proofs that it fed to metamath / ZFC as an oracle, and reports success if the backend prover accepts the proof.

<p>if we think of the set of theorems we have as a data structure, then I think a highly general theorem such as LFPT should be a densely connected node, or there should be some metric for valuing these types of theorems over ones that are less general. I mean I am not a mathematician so this might be very naive, but if we were to throw process cycles at a database of theorems in the hopes of making breakthroughs that connect areas of mathematics we had not realized were related, then this type of activity would be essential</p>

<p>Honestly, given Jesse's demonstration of the proof, I don't value it very highly. The proof is apparently only two lines, which means that if you try to apply this theorem in a particular category the unpacking overhead will be more than the proof itself</p>

<p>if unpacking overhead is small and no new definitions are needed, then it's a pretty low bar to meet, but definitions and unpacking overhead often go together, and category theory is full of small abstract theorems</p>

<p>the unpacking overhead is high because it is applicable in a wider set of contexts, right? i.e. we are talking about breadth vs. depth</p>

<p>Unpacking overhead depends on a few things. Roughly, it depends on the difference between the putative generalization and the concrete instance that it's supposed to be generalizing. Oftentimes it's a literal generalization, as in you have just universally quantified some variable that was already there. Rather than prove 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 we prove a + b = b + a. This kind of generalization has almost no overhead.</p>
<p>A bigger overhead comes from unpacking structures; for example we want that to follow from an abelian group axiom, so we have some <code>&lt;G, +&gt; \in AbGroup</code> and have a theorem <code>&lt;G, +&gt; \in AbGroup -&gt; a \in G -&gt; b \in G -&gt; a + b = b + a</code>. This is still not so bad, because I've unfolded the structure. If it shows up bundled, it might instead be <code>S \in AbGroup -&gt; a \in carrier G -&gt; b \in carrier G -&gt; add G a b = add G b a</code> and now we have to instantiate this with <code>&lt;G, +&gt;</code>, and then replace <code>add &lt;G, +&gt;</code> with <code>+</code> and <code>carrier &lt;G, +&gt;</code> with <code>G</code> everywhere they appear</p>

<p>If, as in lean, we didn't bother to remember that e.g. <code>int</code> is an abelian group, but instead have to traverse the algebraic hierarchy to find the proof, then the overhead is a bit more.</p>

<p>right, so you are saying that you don't value this theorem as much because its abstractness makes it less useful in digging deeper faster, meaning it would not be a useful piece of a superhuman tactic, as it would slow it down.</p>
<p>What I am getting at is that this type of theorem is useful not as a building block, but as a goal in itself, i.e. I care less about theorems that go very deep, and more about the ones that bridge a lot of gaps.</p>

<p>I concede that what I initially wrote is what your point refutes, but it made me realize that an actually useful AI for doing mathematics probably should wrestle with these two conflicting goals of digging deep into a search tree, and the conflicting objective of organizing theorems in such a way that makes them slow to use (but insightful to read)</p>
