<p>I've had a reality check in the "real world" (Skyscanner, a tech company, ~1000 software engineers, customer-facing money-making product).</p>
<p>Here are the results:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically the whole “tom is a type of cat is a type of animal”-style OO has (rightfully) disappeared</p>
<p>If you look at a sensible java/python codebase it doesn’t look so different from the structure of a c/rust/go program</p>
<p>I agree it's a change of mindset. I don't think OO is necessarily less used - but I think it's less often considered The Way to program. More people recognize that it's a tool that has its pros and cons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Code-wise there's of course a lot of C#/python/java in the company (Skyscanner is historically a .net shop, there is still some ancient VB code running in production), and sadly not very much FP, although I know a few data scientists writing scala code (not sure if that counts as "real" FP), and certainly one python code base makes heavy use of <code>functools</code>. I don't think we have any Haskell whatsoever (could be wrong though, it's a big company!), but I could see it happening in a couple of years.</p>

<p>Thank you <em>very much</em> for this. My remit on this committee is to decide which programming languages that my university should be teaching mathematics undergraduates, and we want to be strongly influenced by what people who hire mathematicians want to see. I am going to teach them Lean but only as an option; the issue is what we force them to learn.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure, however, that suggesting that they learn functional programming will not go down well. I suspect that many of our graduates end up working for banks / hedge funds rather than tech companies.</p>

<p>I always find this debate a bit odd. Once you know a few languages, learning one more is not a big deal. Learning how to think about your programs though is not easy and is made much harder once you acquired bad thinking habits. Ideally, you'd like to teach a language that promotes good thinking so that you don't have to spend the whole semester making apologies for the language that you chose.</p>

<p>In short, is your goal to teach how to use a specific programming language or how to build a certain class of programs or how to program in general?</p>

<p>I think a case can be made for Erlang. Especially if you teach distributed systems. My personal number one choice is of course Haskell but it also has drawbacks in educational contexts</p>

<p>I think OCaml can be a good choice. If you have to teach object oriented programming, I like Eiffel a lot. The tools are not the best though</p>

<p>The big problem with teaching Haskell early is that the execution model is hard to grasp so you'd have to wait a few semesters to understand why your programs are slow</p>

<p>Yes, I'd say it's steeper than Haskell. I feel like with Haskell you can start by using it as "executable math" and worry about things like laziness and monads later. In Rust, you can't do anything useful without understanding references and lifetimes first.</p>

<p>I was thinking about that recently, especially with regards to types. I was wondering if you should learn JavaScript before learning Haskell to appreciate how amazing the types are. And then I started wondering, should we do that for every useful invention in the history of programming languages?</p>

<p>And that's precisely the reason why I think teaching "java OOP" or "python OOP" to novices is a bad idea. You can spend <strong>ages</strong> going through language-specific minutiae (mixins, multiple inheritance, generics, type erasure, etc.) without teaching things, which are more important (problem-solving, structuring programs, unit-testing, correctness).</p>

<p>I was listening to Simon Peyton Jones' talk in Canterbury last week, which was on high school CS education, and he said something along the lines (I'm paraphrasing): "It's good that the government recognises that we should teach programming in high schools, but what I'm afraid is going to happen is that we will just teach Python". His point was, again, that there is much more to computer science than programming in any specific language (<code>sorted([2, 3, 1])</code> for example sorts a list in Python, but that fact is entirely educationally useless).</p>
<p>At UoG we cover Python in the first year, but without going too deep into the language, focusing mostly on problem-solving and applications. We do cover all the minutiae of java OOP in the second year, just because we're training future software engineers (and because we have 4 years to produce a graduate in Scotland). But we never cover all the minutiae of Python OOP, since that wouldn't be very educational (students can learn themselves if/when they need it).</p>

<p>Do you mean by that that you want your graduates to know one common language in depth by the time they graduate so that they're ready to start their likely first job?</p>

<p>My specific advise for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> on language choice would be: "don't". Jump through any political fences you'll have to jump through and put together a course with your CS department, following their lead on language choice, and working together on curriculum specifics.</p>
<p>The benefits would be enormous:<br>
1. You don't get an outsider to teach the subject. For a student nothing feels worse than a lecturer who doesn't really understand/ like the subject they're teaching.<br>
2. You pave way for increased collaboration with the CS department. CS and maths really need one another. Don't know what the situation is at ICL, but in Glasgow we definitely don't have enough maths-CS collaboration, and it's not just my view, I've discussed this a few times with Muffy Calder for example.</p>

The pressure from the top is that our graduates should be "industry-ready" by 3rd year (Glasgow is <strong>very</strong> industry-focused, unlike for example Edinburgh, who get away with teaching Haskell to first years and Coq later in the course), and I imagine knowing one language in-depth is considered part of that "readiness". We do some cool stuff in the 4th year (FP, Constraints Programming, AI), and it's much more "bottom-up" with 4th year modules.</p>

<p>That's interesting, I didn't know about Edinburgh. Do you have any comparison about how well their graduates do on the job market? Or whether more of their students go to grad school?</p>

<p>At YorkU, our engineering school is pretty young and we're only now getting started with a software engineering degree. My supervisor was the one  behind the push and we caught some flak when the time came for accreditation because too much attention was paid to formal specification. One of the guys doing the accreditation was an agile methodologist</p>

<p>Sure, there is this website called UNISTATS, it uses data from "Destination of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE)". Not sure if the links will work, but you should be able to search for Computing Science degrees from multiple universities:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10007794FT-G400-2208/ReturnTo/Search" target="_blank" title="https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10007794FT-G400-2208/ReturnTo/Search">https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10007794FT-G400-2208/ReturnTo/Search</a><br>
2. <a href="https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10007790FT-UTCMPSIBENGH/ReturnTo/Search" target="_blank" title="https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10007790FT-UTCMPSIBENGH/ReturnTo/Search">https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10007790FT-UTCMPSIBENGH/ReturnTo/Search</a></p>
<p>The results are quite counter-intuitive. It appears that Edinburgh has slightly higher employment rate, and actually more industry employment and less further study.</p>
<p>Maybe students from Edinburgh are like "Enough of this theoretical nonsense, I want to do something real for a change" :D.</p>
<p>Also, the data is almost certainly skewed by JPMorgan. It's the biggest CS employer in Glasgow, easily 30-40% of our graduates go into JP, and they get a good starting salary of 32k or so, which I think is the reason why Glasgow graduates earn better money than Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> sadly, the DLHE data can't settle the "hedge fund" vs "tech company" question. The data is not fine-grained enough, with only a very broad category of "Business and public service associate professionals", which is where 65% Mathematics ICL undergraduates land 6-months after their degree: <a href="https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10003270FT-G100/ReturnTo/Search" target="_blank" title="https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10003270FT-G100/ReturnTo/Search">https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10003270FT-G100/ReturnTo/Search</a></p>
<p>Also, the data is 6 months post-graduation, what would be also nice to see is data ~5 years post-graduation, but I'm not sure if it exists.</p>
<p>Anecdotally I know of 1 mathematician in Skyscanner, doing great, and 2 mathematicians at UoG CS, both doing great, but that's not too scientific I'm afraid :/</p>

<p>Personally, if I could go back 10 years in time, I would have advised my young and foolish self to consider going to Edinburgh. Although I did switch my main degree to JH in maths + CS at Glasgow, which worked quite well in the end.  A fun fact: my wife got unconditional from Edinburgh, but she didn't go because none of her friends went. So I would have to find her too and advise her the same, or we wouldn't have met otherwise :D</p>

<p>Also I really have a hard time imagining functional programming scaling to real world programming but I'd love to learn I'm wrong (I read a book on Haskell recently and it only seemed to be about solving problems created by the functional paradigm). My experience in real world is that you quickly get tired of adding millions of arguments to functions in order to get flexibility. Compare with the beginning of <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/fr/2.0/topics/class-based-views/intro/" target="_blank" title="https://docs.djangoproject.com/fr/2.0/topics/class-based-views/intro/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/fr/2.0/topics/class-based-views/intro/</a> for instance. But again this is only my amateur end-user view-point, I'm neither a computer scientist nor a professional programmer.</p>

<p>Re (∞, 1)-category theorist -- not sure what ICL compsi looks like, but at Glasgow we have plenty of down-to-earth engineering-type people I would trust to do a decent job with co-teaching such course. That being said we have of course a fair share of "(∞, 1)-category theorists", so it's definitely something to be wary of.</p>

<p>No disagreement that popularity(OOP) &gt; popularity(FP).</p>
<p>But if we look at the derivative...</p>
<p>The sentiment in industry (or certainly the slice of industry I'm a part of) is that there is a swing from "rich OOP" (Tom is a Cat is an Animal or SimpleBeanFactoryAwareAspectInstanceFactory), back to more readable procedural/ imperative style. FP is still a bit in the shadows unfortunately, but pace of change in software engineering is very quick. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw internal Haskell products popping up in  major tech companies few years down the line.</p>

<p>What languages are the 2.5 writing software using?</p>

<p>Likewise, I will have  a lot of people writing software in my professional network. I think this is called Prosecutor's Fallacy or something like that.</p>

<p>What you need is better DLHE data. As it is DLHE is just too coarse: <a href="https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10003270FT-G100/ReturnTo/Search" target="_blank" title="https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10003270FT-G100/ReturnTo/Search">https://unistats.ac.uk/subjects/employment/10003270FT-G100/ReturnTo/Search</a></p>
