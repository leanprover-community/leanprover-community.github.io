<p>I am still very new to lean but I have been browsing through mathlib these days. I would like to share one obstacle I observed that an ordinary mathematician would face when trying to understanding lean code. That is, <strong>abbreviation of mathematical terms</strong>.  For example, look at this definition of an outer measure:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>structure outer_measure (α : Type*) :=
(measure_of : set α → ennreal)
(empty : measure_of ∅ = 0)
(mono : ∀{s₁ s₂}, s₁ ⊆ s₂ → measure_of s₁ ≤ measure_of s₂)
(Union_nat : ∀(s:ℕ → set α), measure_of (⋃i, s i) ≤ (∑i, measure_of (s i)))
</pre></div>


<p>In this case, since I am familiar with the definition, I can guess that ennreal = extented non-negative reals, mono=monotonicity, Union_nat= countable subadditivity. But others might get it. Moreover, sometimes the abbreviation is long and odd looking and it's hard to guess its meaning. I understand that abbreviation can shorten the code, but I would argue that in the statement of major definitions or theorems, it worthes avoiding abbreviation in order to increase the readability to ordinary mathematicians.</p>

<p>I can't see it in mathlib. But even if so, there are still many examples of abbreviation causing confusion.</p>

<p>The naming follows a somewhat rigid convention in order to make it easier to guess the names of theorems. Mathematicians are not globally consistent in how things get named, so if you try to follow that kind of pattern you end up confusing even yourself after a while</p>

<p>For the particular case of fields of <code>outer_measure</code>, I wouldn't associate much to the particular names. It's just a bunch of axioms</p>

<p>For example in most presentations of, say, vector spaces you find in textbooks it's just a list of equalities. You can give them names, but they aren't that helpful</p>

<p>It's true that it is somewhat of an idiolect that you have to learn, but there is no way around that. Using mathematician naming for the things that mathematicians bothered to name would just make it a more inconsistent language</p>

<p>With a version of the perfectoid project up until a few weeks ago, we had specifically tried to make our definition of a perfectoid space readable by mathematicians. More recently we've been trying to actually get it to compile, and now it is probably less readable (and still doesn't compile), however it is still pretty readable, indeed it's more readable than it was yesterday morning, and one high priority issue after we get it working will be to make it better readable.</p>

<p>Perfectoid ring is not bad really. Note that one difference is that perfectoid_ring is written by mathematicians, and outer_measure was written by computer scientists.</p>

<p>Johan says outer measure isn't really that bad either -- there is obviously an initial learning curve when it comes to the basic definitions. One can also define notation to fix these problems. How would you like to express ennreal? Any unicode stuff we can do.</p>

<p>I'm gonna agree with Kevin here and say that while long, pretty names are quite nice when you're new and trying to understand the material, there's always going to be a learning curve for reading code when it comes to any language. As long as there's some note at the construction saying that ennreal is the extended non-negative reals, abbreviation is more than acceptable. It gets quite tedious trying to use a certain object over and over again when referencing it takes more than 10-15 characters to type.</p>
<p>Mathematica isn't really a good analogue, because it's not a language in which you're typing dozens of lines of code. A lot of mathematica is note-taking and use of wolfram alpha.</p>

<p>Furthermore, mathematica's code is almost purely computational. You don't have to write out the same words hundreds of times. If refl were reflexive_property and simp were simplify_goal, we'd all go crazy</p>

<p>ya, i agree that there should be a package of abbreviation that we need to remember. abbreviation in proofs are certainly needed. i just think that we could pay attention to <strong>have a balance between brevity and readability</strong>, especially in major definition and theoems</p>

<p>That sounds like an unnecessary mess to deal with. If we're going to define a theorem name, we should do it for usability. Why would you make a naming convention that you're never going to use, and instead overwrite it?</p>

<p>There are actual difficulties in using a proof assistant, and getting used to ennreal is <em>not</em> one of them</p>

<p>I agree that it's important for mathematicians to be able to use Lean, especially since I'm one of them. But just like you said in the very beginning, you could already guess what the ennreals are because you were familiar with the construction. Which shows the convention works. And if you aren't familiar with the construction in mathematics, you probably aren't ready to be messing around with it in Lean.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="218709">@Adrian Chu</span> What we <em>could</em> is write a lot more docstrings. Those are comments in the code that show up when you hover over a term in VScode. (So hovering your mouse cursor over <code>ennreal</code> would show a box saying: "The type of non-negative reals with positive infinity". Maybe it even already does that.) Reading Lean code outside of a proper IDE is pretty unusable anyways, but inside VScode (or Emacs) this could be fairly usable. However, lots of things don't currently have docstrings.</p>

<p>I would like a glossary or something like that. The idea is to look up a maths thing, and find out what it's called in Lean, and maybe the most basic peculiarities you need to be aware of to use it.

<p>I looked a little at a doxygen/javadocs esque thing, one thing to note is that e.g. docstrings are in the olean files, so available from Mario's <em>olean-rs</em>, When looking at it I was wondering if it wouldn't be possible to do Patrick's <em>format-lean</em> in docstrings, which I view much as like what Greg mentions above, but in source code comments rather than an external file.</p>
<p>The issue there was that docstrings weren't available in the proof contents you cannot have a docstring for a have statement.  E.g. docstrings get associated with a symbol, I didn't see a way to associate them with a file:line location as well.   Anyhow i felt the whole thing would probably be outdated once the lean4 parser in lean came along anyways,  should revisit it I suppose.</p>

<p>I noticed another issue. Every lemma in lean code has a name, like <code> mem_gpowers_iff_mem_range_order_of</code>, <code>sum_card_order_of_eq_card_pow_eq_one</code>. These names only make sense only after looking at the statement of the lemma. An innocent thought: <strong>why don't we just use numberings like lemma_12, together with a longer and more readable comment?</strong> In this way, when we later need to quote this, we can type much less;  and we no longer need to guess what the string of abbreviation means.</p>

<p>Maybe a <strong>better proposal</strong> is like this: we use abbreviations as names of lemma, but we also write a comment, which expands the abbreviation, for every lemma. And wherever this lemma is quoted, we can see that comment for an explanation by hovering on its name.</p>

<p>What you don't see is that what to you looks like a useless lemma name is to me an absolutely crucial method for funding the lemma. Once you can start to begin to guess what technical lemmas are called, you can find them by guessing half the name and then using basic search functionality like ctrl-space. I actually use the fact that these lemmas are named well as part of my workflow and, in contrast to my initial instincts, I now believe that the system scales well. In my formalisation of parts of the stacks project I deviated from the computer scientist's advice in naming things (files in this case -- I used stacks projects tags) and it was a disaster. This is analogous to rejecting the suggestion that chapters of a book should be called chapter 1, chapter 2 etc. We all do it but it turns out to be a terrible idea now better naming conventions are available</p>

<p>If the only purpose of the comment is to expand the abbreviations in it, then that's not a very good comment. It's like the infamous</p>

<p>which says what the code says without adding anything. Comments are to provide information that <em>can't</em> be gleaned from the code itself, like relations to other concepts, alternate names, references to the literature, and architectural comments</p>

<p>When you hover over a lemma name, lean will show the statement of the lemma, which mostly addresses the question of "what does this theorem assert?". If the statement is long or complicated, then an english gloss is helpful for connecting it to standard mathematical terminology. Actually I think english glosses are usually a good idea, since the duplication of the statement in two different languages can help reinforce the concept. But if it can be generated automatically then it's a rubbish comment</p>

<p>The last theorem prover I worked on, Metamath, has a style rule that all theorems must have a comment. It doesn't have to be much, but there has to be something. This is remarkably effective at generating pervasive documentation</p>

<p>Right... It may be very hard to create a mathematical document that is useful as:</p>
<ul>
<li>certificate of correctness of the theory</li>
<li>reference text for those who know the theory</li>
<li>teaching material for those who don't know the theory</li>
</ul>
<p>But we can still strive to get at much of that as possible. Only Lean will not let us compromise on the first item.</p>

<p>As a newcomer myself, I would agree with Adrian Chu's initial opinion. Two more thoughts. First, whenever one has to weigh readers against writers, shouldn't one side with the readers? In the end, isn't the hope that every theorem will be read much more often than written?  That more time will be spent, overall, reading a theorem than writing it? Second, when it comes to the pain of writing long names, don't modern editors take the burden away from the writer by offering a list of possible completions?</p>

<p>This is the Lean definition of <code>outer_measure</code>. As you can see from the link, there is absolutely no context or even a docstring. Several suggestions have been made about how to make this definition more readily accessible to passing mathematicians. Not all of them are viable -- for example changing constructor names breaks code, and to a computer scientist (and this code was written by a computer scientist) there is nothing wrong with the names anyway -- in fact several of them are the canonical names for what they are doing. Mathematicians don't know this part of the story though. Adrian can only understand the definition because he has seen the definition in more mathematician-friendly places, e.g. a book, or Wikipedia or something -- something which was written to be read by humans. This code was not. However as a human myself, I did once try to learn what mathlib was all about by reading mathlib and I found it extremely difficult to get anywhere. In the end I learnt what it was about by taking mathematics I understood, like the definition of a scheme, and trying to write it in Lean. But we can do better in this instance.</p>
<p>How would the maintainers feel about a small PR containing only comments about what was going on in this definition, and perhaps a reference to the literature or Wikipedia?</p>

<p>1. Do the creator/contributors of mathlib have a common consensus on, in the long run, (a) who is the target reader/user of mathlib?, (b) what are all the purpose of mathlib? In my opinion, having a clear answer to these 2 questions would tell us what style should lean code adopt.<br>
2. The following is about promotions of lean.  Please keep in mind that, something with little practical value (say, from a programmer's point of view) could have significant promotional value. People's reluctance to use or learn something (lean in this case) is often emotional. Consider the fact that in this early stage, people really don't have much incentive to learn/use lean, I would argue that any writing style of lean code that brings clarity and transparency would be a big attractive factor to outsiders.<br>
3. Following point 2. Newcomers of lean certainly do not install lean immediately, they will probably first poke around and look at mathlib through github. But in github, we can't see any of the docstring or link to definition, etc. So from a promotional point of view, this is no good.</p>

<p>I think the target user and reader of mathlib is a computer ;-) The purpose of mathlib is that it is a tool to help humans formalise definitions of objects and statements and proofs of theorems, with the ultimate goal of changing the way mathematicians work -- for example, supplying them with better search tools. But the humans formalising the definitions need to be trained, and they need to be trained to read mathlib, at least if mathlib stays as it is.</p>

<p>I posted our definition of a perfectoid space and to a programmer this has little practical value but I personally believe that there will be a lot of promotional value at least in mathematics departments. This is not really the computer scientists' job though. They need to ensure that they have a library which compiles without too much trouble and provides a solid API for most of the things it claims to be offering.</p>

<p>I think that the mathlib devs already have a clear idea of what they think mathlib should look like, and that's why it looks like what it looks like. They have already made it quite clear to me that they do not want long clear proofs of simple statements; they would rather have obfuscated one-liners (not least because they probably compile quicker).</p>

<p>The Xena project has a bunch of material which might be much easier to read, however it is all undergraduate level. This might not matter though -- my experience is that most staff are far too busy to be thinking about learning a new language. The undergraduates are more likely to be reading mathlib than the staff, in a maths department. This is why we need more teaching material which is accessible to undergraduate mathematicians.</p>

<p>And look at people like Neil Strickland, who contribute sometimes. Take-up is slow, but non-zero. However amongst the students I see far more enthusiasm. They don't read mathlib though, they tend to look at materials that I make, or learn from each other. They certainly use mathlib though.</p>

<p>learning to read/use <code>mathlib</code> is definitely a skill by itself---we're planning some lectures at this year's formal abstracts summer school specifically about 1) familiarizing yourself with existing libraries and 2) building your own library (this includes things like best practices for <code>simp</code> lemmas, etc)</p>

<p>Sorry for the miscommunication. I meant to say "LARGESCALE participation by mathematician". Let's imagine someday lean is so popular that lots of mathematician uses it. The best case scenario I can imagine is that mathematician use lean to formalize the STATEMENT of the theorems they discovered and then add it into the mathlib database. When the foundational material of mathlib is sufficient, I can imagine that it wouldn't take much effort to do so.</p>

<p>The reason I think it won't take too much effort is that, when I show to my friend (a math graduate student who haven't seen lean before) the lean code of definitions of, say, the Hausdorff topology or outer measure, he easily understand the rough meaning of the code.</p>

<p>Perhaps one should also keep in mind that Coq has been around for three decades and has yet to see widespread adoption. Lean is technically more readable but not to the extent to turn itps into the new thing, at least not without "too much effort".</p>

<p>I think that Coq has been very poorly marketed [to the maths community] by the CS community. I think that this is because the CS community has no idea what makes the maths community tick. The proof of the odd order theorem shows us that formal proof verifiers are capable of understanding several hundred pages of lemmas about group theory. This is a really useful data point for the CS people. But mathematicians don't care about the maths -- this is 50 years old and well-known, it is a major result in what is now regarded as a dead area. This is my question to the Coq community -- where are all the modern research level objects which get mathematicians excited? Where are the formalisations of the Millennium problems? Where are <em>schemes</em>? Where is all the stuff that research mathematicians are interested in? I looked and looked and I can find very little. In Lean we are doing things differently. The development of the maths library is now in general being done by people who have mathematical goals -- for example I want to formalise the global Langlands conjectures so am gently pushing people to do algebraic closure of fields, Galois theory, group cohomology, global fields etc. These things might just all be done in random places in Coq Contribs or whatever -- or maybe they're not even there at all. In fact I am certain that the Langlands conjectures are not there -- because this isn't the kind of thing that was getting done in Coq. I am not even sure there is a human alive on this planet who knows enough about Coq and enough about the Langlands conjectures to be able to even write the code. We are driving the Lean maths library project towards objects which <em>real mathematicians actually care about</em>. Once we have a large collection of these things, we will look completely different to Coq because our library will reflect a much more modern mathematics. So I reject the argument that says that history is not on our side.</p>

<p>Thanks for this clear statement. This sounds to me as if another layer of interface on top of mathlib was needed. Has anybody been thinking about how to do something like this? An interface that would allow a mathematician to use lean without having to access mathlib?</p>

<p>I think this is a really interesting question. Patrick has been working on some wonderful ways of presenting Lean code so that mathematicians can see relevant parts of it -- for example <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/lean/sandwich.html" target="_blank" title="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/lean/sandwich.html">I wrote this proof of the sandwich theorem</a> to show my undergraduates, and if you click on a line in the proof and then click on one of the small grey boxes which appear, you will be able to see Lean's tactic state at that point in the proof. Mathematicians can understand the tactic state, and if we work harder with notation (which Lean 4 will enable us to do) we will be able to make it even easier for them to understand.</p>

<p>And Lean 4 will enable us to make it look even better. However I do not know how to make this interface that you're talking about to enable mathematicians to write Lean code. Let's face it -- even if we had some mega version of Patrick's formatter which made mathlib just look like a maths book -- that won't help mathematicians to be able to <em>write Lean code</em>, which will still look like <code>intros x, apply eq_of_ne_of_supremum_positive, ...</code></p>

<p>The only solution I can see so far with getting mathematicians to use Lean is to actually teach them how to write proofs in tactic mode. Once we have more mathematical objects and conjectures we can start thinking about how to interact with the software in other ways -- for example, via search. Then this will give mathematicians new ways of being able to benefit from the software without having to learn how to write Lean code. That's what we want, really. Until then we need to train people to be able to write Lean code.</p>

<p>Does using Wikipedia + Google + ArXiv really work? I've had MSc students coming into my office brandishing printouts of 5 page pdfs which they found using Google when trying to answer a technical question, and the pdfs were written by  PhD students perhaps as notes for a talk they had to give on material they didn't understand, and the notes are full of crap but this is not easy for my MSc student to figure out because it's in LaTeX so looks nice</p>

<p>Can you find a proof in the literature that every complete intersection ring is Cohen--Macauley using Google and Wikipedia and ArXiv? And even if you can, could you imagine a world where this question would not even be worth considering because the answer was "obviously yes"? If I were to ask you if it was possible to find a picture of a china teapot on the internet you would say "of course!'. It is completely trivial to do now. But I remember a time when it was impossible to do.</p>

<p>Ah, I see what you mean. Mathlib can serve as a database of small, specific, technical lemma. I think the reason why we can't find proof of technical lemmas in literature is that no one bothers to write them down: the experts think they are well-known and can be easily derived.</p>

<p>Not just technical lemmas necessarily -- theorems announced in the literature whose proofs are not formalised. Once we have enough definitions with sufficiently good API <em>then</em> mathematicians will be able to start making their own definitions. At the minute it is really hard to make a meaty definition in Lean -- witness the fact that it just took a team of us months and months to do perfectoid spaces.

<p>We could make a big graph of what has been formalised, and a much bigger graph of what is claimed to be true in the informal literature, and then just give it to search experts and say "what do you need to make this good?" and they'll say "we need 1000 more theorems" and then I'll just start banging on on the interwebs or whatever about how we need important theorems in all of pure maths, and PhD students will randomly start formalising them and adding them to Hales' database. Why not? I can see this being a reality if this stuff catches on. At the minute it's too hard. But I think I see a way to make it not hard in the future. And these machine learning people are desperate for databases; they just use TPTP all the time, it seems to me. That's not mathematics -- that's just big Sudoku problems in some sense.</p>

<p>I think many mathematician probably won't bother to formalize proof, because I GUESS: even if the mathlib or lean language become mature enough, formalizing a PROOF will still be a few times more tedious/difficult than writing it into a paper. And just formalizing the statement of theorems/lemma are probably enough for a searching purpose?</p>

<p>But I need to be careful. I have been going round the UK preaching on "pure mathematics in crisis" and several people said to me that I was over-stating the case. As a consequence I had to think harder about this issue and talk to many people about how they felt about the fact that the community accepts proofs which are not at all well documented, and after a while I began to learn about how this was not a completely unreasonable point of view.</p>

<p>I am among those who are more skeptical. Recent advances in AI are due to machine learning which is very data hungry. Winning the IMO needs, afaics,  to combine what ML is good at with using logic and learning from small number of examples ... this seems to be a challenge I have not seen yet much convincing progress (but I am not in ML or AI, so I might have missed it) ... any pointers welcome ... we would also need a natural language interface to theorem provers, is anyone working on this?</p>

<p>There was someone from Deep Mind at AITP but they were not involved with the Alpha zero stuff. If a "game" is a 2 player thing then it seems to me that it's "puzzles" and theorem proving which are the most similar. One key difference is that maths is infinite whereas puzzles typically are not.</p>

<p>yes I agree that it's more like puzzle solving than playing a multiplayer game, but there is an area of study called Game Semantics that thinks of logic as a game played between the prover/computer/human vs. the omniscient disprover/environment/devil</p>

<p>furthermore, it seems like the ML people doing theorem proving are mostly focusing on trying to learn the activity of theorem proving by using theorems proved by humans as data, but one thing that I think TP and classical game type AI have in common, is that by defining the rules of the game, you can generate as much synthetic data as you please</p>

<p>you can think of a logical formula as a game, where each sub-expression represents a sub game-tree with the rules, where the play/proof advances play by play:</p>
<ul>
<li>the game is between the Verifier and Falsifier, and it ends when there are only atomic expressions left. If the expression is <code>true</code> then V wins, and if it is <code>false</code> then F wins.</li>
<li>each logical operation is given meaning according to how it advances the game, so:<ul>
<li><code>A ∧ B</code> is a node in which the Falsifier gets to choose between A or B.</li>
<li><code>A ∨ B</code> the same, but V gets to decide instead</li>
<li><code>∀ (x : A), body</code> the Falsifier chooses a value of A for which the play continues in body</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>etc. The game is winnable by the Verifier if he has a winning strategy against an omniscient opponent.</p>

<p>This was pointed out to be a serious issue at AITP by one of the google speakers. It's hard to train an AI with such a poor definition of progress as the one we have: either "no, you have not done it, 0 points" or "yes, you have done it, all the points"</p>

<p>A really simple example:<br>
<code>(h : p ∧ q) : q ∧ p</code></p>
<p>So we are looking for a strategy for a game <code>q ∧ p</code>, where we have another game <code>p ∧ q</code> as a resource (hypothesis).</p>
<p>Since we are playing the and-game, the Falsifier gets to choose between <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>, and because we think of our strategy as a proof, then this means we have to describe what we would do in either case.</p>
<p>If F chooses <code>p</code>, then if we can provide a <code>p</code> then we win. We can get <code>p</code> by playing through our resource, where now the roles are reversed, which means we get to choose. Se we of course choose <code>p</code> and win this game. If F chooses <code>q</code> we similarly choose <code>q</code> from our hypotheses and thus we win the game regardless of what F chose.</p>
<p>Why are the roles reversed when we play in the resource game? Well I have to confess I am not sure if I know how to explain it, but I can make a few observations:</p>
<p>Classically A → B is the same as ¬A ∨ B, so an implies-game is a game where the Verifier gets to choose between playing the B-game or the reverse game of A.</p>
<p>So in our example if we instead are proving (p ∧ q) → (q ∧ p) which we kind of are, then this is a bigger game that is classically the ¬(p ∧ q) ∨ (q ∧ p) game, and because we are at the disjunction-node, the Verifier can choose to play the reverse game ¬(p ∧ q) which is just the game (p ∧ q) with the roles reversed. This means that eventhough we are dealing with an and-game, this time we the Verifier get to choose.</p>

<p>The holist link -- that's exactly the google people who were at AITP. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03241" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03241">https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03241</a> . Szegedy was the guy who thinks maths will be done better by computers than by humans within 10 years. I talked to the authors of that project and they said that to a large extent their work was system-agnostic so could certainly be applied to Lean. They then asked me a couple of of technical questions about accessing Lean stuff programatically which I had no clue about.</p>

<p>My cynical take on it is that the CS people are a million miles from proving anything that a mathematician might find interesting</p>

<p>I had some interesting email exchanges with Josef Urban around the time of the conference, I'll try to remember to summarise them when I'm near a computer -- they had some interesting links. A cynic's view -- the CS people like databases of theorems to train their AIs on and the only databases so far are the odd order work, flyspeck, TPTP, and the libraries for the theorem provers</p>

<p>I'd be interested in this, if you're still willing!</p>

<p>"We can't prove <a href="http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/7.13.01_4.181.1147/html/yellow19#T36" target="_blank" title="http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/7.13.01_4.181.1147/html/yellow19#T36">http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/7.13.01_4.181.1147/html/yellow19#T36</a> with ATPs, although it's probably close - we can prove e.g. T35.

<p>"I don't like that the ML and ATP people do not look at what they proved and only count numbers. They may miss some important insights. I do that often - to see what/how happens. See e.g. the examples of proved things in section 6 of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-014-9303-3" target="_blank" title="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-014-9303-3">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-014-9303-3</a> ."</p>

News from the "State-of-the-art ATP over Large Math Corpora" department.</p>
<p>Enigma has just proved in 0.7s this problem: <a href="http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/7.13.01_4.181.1147/html/connsp_1#T14" target="_blank" title="http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/7.13.01_4.181.1147/html/connsp_1#T14">http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/7.13.01_4.181.1147/html/connsp_1#T14</a></p>
<p>It says that an image of a connected topological space under a continuous mapping is also a connected space.</p>
<p>The TPTP file is at  <a href="http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/t14_connsp_1/t14_connsp_1" target="_blank" title="http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/t14_connsp_1/t14_connsp_1">http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/t14_connsp_1/t14_connsp_1</a> , the ATP proof at <a href="http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/t14_connsp_1/t14_connsp_1.out3" target="_blank" title="http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/t14_connsp_1/t14_connsp_1.out3">http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/t14_connsp_1/t14_connsp_1.out3</a> , and the ATP proof visualization at  <a href="http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/t14_connsp_1/t14_connsp_1.svg" target="_blank" title="http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/t14_connsp_1/t14_connsp_1.svg">http://grid01.ciirc.cvut.cz/~mptp/t14_connsp_1/t14_connsp_1.svg</a> . No other ATP can prove this in 60s, and we could not prove this before with many ATPs in 300s.</p>
<p>E was given 118 facts (145 clauses) about topology, connectedness, functions, relations, structures and sets, and it used 28 of them in the proof. The Mizar proof explicitly mentions 9 facts. The remaining 19 facts needed for the ATP proof are Mizar typing and "obvious" rules - like that every function is also a relation and that set intersection is commutative.</p>
<p>The E proof consists of about 108 clausal inferences. The proof search took 1177 nontrivial given clauses (1982 in total - included trivial and subsumed ones). And it generated 7k causes in total.</p>
<p>These are quite nice numbers: the proof is relatively long compared to the number of processed clauses, and the number of processed clauses is relatively high compared to the number of generated clauses.</p>
<p>I think Enigma is learning how to suppress too prolific inferences, and also how to routinely do the "mundane" mathematical stuff at the very bottom - like trivial operations over sets, relations and functions.</p>
<p>Examples like this could eventually go into some paper - or we could start a blog called "Advances of Automated Mathematicians" ;-).<br>
