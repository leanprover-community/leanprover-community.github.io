<p>I'd like to share something I've been working on for a while in an attempt to learn more about Lean's internals and how the gears of dependent types turn (I think I remember seeing a few Rust fans here too). <a href="https://github.com/ammkrn/nanoda.git" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/ammkrn/nanoda.git">https://github.com/ammkrn/nanoda.git</a>  <br>
Going forward I'll be trying to add features aimed at exposing the internals in an informative way and expanding the documentation until (hopefully) the whole thing is annotated.</p>

<p>I wonder if we can hook this up with olean-rs to get typechecking straight from olean files</p>

<p>Is there any chance of modifying it to be proof-producing? Specifically, I would like a record of how definitional equalities are proven so that it can be consumed by a much less intelligent verifier</p>

<p>Sure, I can put in an option to output the intermediate states of two terms as they go through reduction/inference during the definitional equality checking if that's what you mean.</p>

<p>Yes, that's the idea. I've been wanting to translate lean proofs into other languages for a while now, and the main blocker is that lean proofs leave a lot of work unfinished to be cleaned up by the typechecker.</p>

<p>The other big thing I guess is inductive types, although I'm not sure how useful you can make the trace. Ideally I would want a record of why the typechecker thinks an inductive definition is permitted, and how it built the intro and recursion rules and the computation rule</p>

<p>Construction of the intro/elim/reduction rules for inductive types is fairly procedural and they're built from components that exist separately earlier in the module so that shouldn't be hard. wrt to why the typechecker gives any particular definition the thumbs up you might have to narrow down what parts of the 'history' you need since some of the steps produce really large amounts of intermediate info.</p>

<p>but it's possible I can reconstruct the rest from a reasonable amount of tracing data</p>

<p>One way to describe the problem is that I want a trace that does not require knowledge of the rules of dependent type theory to verify</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Could you be more specific about this? If you are talking about repeated information that's not a problem, as it can be backreferenced, but if you are generating huge terms during reduction from small inputs that's actually what I care to capture. I assume that doesn't happen very often in lean proofs though</p>

<p>I guess it depends on whether you plan on using an export file type deal or if you want to connect the tools directly. The terms aren't large in terms of memory consumption since the trees are mostly pointers, but the expressions themselves are frequently large in terms of the number of nodes/leaves and they go through a lot of steps in the checker, so if you try to put all that information somewhere persistent like text, then the history can get really big. When I was first trying to figure out why some things worked the way they do I was just doing naive logging and would get these runaway 300 MB log files.</p>

<p>Right, the problem with pp.all style printing is it ignores subterm duplication, which can cause exponential blowup at the printing stage</p>

<p>Any method that explicitly represents subterm duplication should be able to address this problem. The export file format uses numbered backreferences, or in human readable printing you can insert <code>let</code>s, or you can just do a memory dump (although this is tricky to set up reliably)</p>

<p>I usually find the easiest thing to implement is numbered backreferences. You just keep a hashmap of exprs you've printed so far, and every time you see one you have printed before you print a reference to it rather than printing the whole term again</p>

<p>That's basically what the export format printer does too</p>

<p>I have a program I want to pipe this into but it would probably be easiest to communicate using some intermediate file format rather than via RPC (plus the intermediate file format has independent interest as a more-explicit lean export format)</p>

<p>Some back of the envelope numbers, in checking mathlib, <code>infer</code> gets called 44.3 million times, <code>def_eq</code> 4.7 million.</p>

<p>I'll check later how much that goes down by if the caches for inference/definitional equality checks are reused globally.</p>
