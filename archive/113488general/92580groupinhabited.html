<p>Should we show that every group is inhabited? Should we generalize it to has_one and has_zero? Which one will ring choose?</p>

<p>I'm inclined to say no. <code>inhabited</code> is more of a programming notion, a way to acquire a "default" value when it doesn't matter what value is picked. The value has no semantic meaning, so it doesn't matter if one or zero is picked. But I don't think that a typeclass search for <code>inhabited</code> should go on an algebraic quest to prove that it's an R-module just because that implies it's inhabited. It would be better to have the types themselves register as inhabited, to keep it simple.</p>

<p>ok</p>
