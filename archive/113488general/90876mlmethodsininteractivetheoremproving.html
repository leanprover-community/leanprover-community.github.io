<p>interesting paper here: "GamePad: A Learning Environment for Theorem Proving" <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00608" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00608">https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00608</a><br>
unfortunately the conclusion is the same as it has been for the past 30 years... not quite there yet, needs more funding and research :)</p>

<p>"We also note that position evaluation &lt;omitted&gt; should assign a high number to proof states which do not yet contain the requisite hypotheses to prove the current goal." This metric (representing how far someone is from completing a proof) seems so silly - sadly I can't check how well this works in practice without compiling their entire project because  their results sub-chapter doesn't say much :(.</p>

<p>i wish they had dealt with <code>have</code> statements properly. in a way, they can be regarded as additional  lemmas</p>

<p>I can't get it to compile. I wanted to check how many steps would be predicted for FLT to reaffirm myself in the belief that this is an incredibly random metric :).</p>
