<p>Hey guys, one of my student software developers (bright and hard-working, the type I like!) is going idle from today (we've just finished a project). He doesn't do any lean, but he's very good with windows installers, linux packaging, iOS apps, android apps and all sorts of boring software engineering fluff (actually he doesn't think it's boring, which is why I like him even more!). I think lean could use some help in that regard. Happy to chat more if anybody's interested. I vaguely remember <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  in particular raising some issues with windows installers for lean or something along the lines.</p>

<p>The challenge is extremely easy to state: say you have a colleague who wants to try maths in Lean, either on Linux, MacOS or Windows. We want him to download one file, execute it, wait at most 3 minutes, and be ready to fire either emacs or VScode and  play.</p>

<p>I guess it's fair to assume emacs is already installed if the colleague want to use emacs, but the default stuff should be to install VScode along the way, unless the user explicitly refuses to get it.</p>

<p>I realise that this is something, which is badly needed, and happy to put some work to make it happen (especially working with Marcell, he's a really a brilliant software dev), but I'm afraid there would have to be a stream of funding for this. Marcell uses these kinds of jobs to pay for his rent, etc. and I don't think we could have him volunteer to do this.</p>

<p>I could maybe ask for some money from SICSA, but it's a bit hard given that this isn't, strictly speaking, research: <a href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/funding/" target="_blank" title="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/funding/">http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/funding/</a></p>

<p>Another idea, which comes to mind is Google Summer of Code, but this is a lot of work, lean would have to become an affiliated partner, etc.</p>

<p>The thing is, I'm pretty sure, if we get all the pipelines with all the installers nicely polished, swapping the binary from Lean 3 to Lean 4 would be no problem at all.</p>
