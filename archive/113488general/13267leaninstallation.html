<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> I was fortunate to have my operating system crash last week so that I could try your one-line installation of Lean. It worked beautifully. Many thanks. In fact, it worked so well that I decided to follow your further instructions to set up a Lean project with a local copy of mathlib, rather than using on a global copy, as I have done all along. The instructions again worked exactly as advertised.</p>
<p>I have two small notes. The first is that, because I had already installed VSCode through the Ubuntu package manager (which in 18.04 is <code>snap</code> rather than <code>apt</code>), I ended up with two copies of VSCode. (I used <code>apt remove</code> to remove one.) Second, if I understand correctly, the appropriate way to update mathlib in my project is now to use <code>leanpkg upgrade</code> and then <code>mathlib-update</code>.  It might be helpful to say that in <code>project.md</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the excellent installation procedure and documentation!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> Just for the record: it is <code>update-mathlib</code>...</p>

<p>Concerning the <code>apt</code> vs other pkg managers issue: maybe we should use a different way to test whether VSCode is already installed.</p>

<p>Thanks Jeremy!  Indeed <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/blob/master/scripts/install_debian.sh" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/blob/master/scripts/install_debian.sh">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/blob/master/scripts/install_debian.sh</a> currently doesn't test at  all whether VScode is installed. It assumes that everybody uses <code>apt</code> or doesn't want automatic installation of anything. It seems Ubuntu created a mess with <code>snap</code>. But I'll add a simple test anyway.</p>

<p>Thanks. I won't defend Ubuntu. More often than not, I use <code>apt</code> from a terminal instead of <code>snap</code>. For example, <code>snap</code> doesn't seem to know about <code>texlive</code>.</p>

<p>In my experience lots of the snaps are just plain broken too, e.g. the vscode one</p>
