<p>Is it possible to formulate and prove in Lean (together with the univalence axiom from homotopy type theory) the statement<br>
"Isomorphic groups have the same (structural) properties."<br>
Or is this just like a meta property that cannot be formulated in Lean?</p>
<p>Of course, one could formulate the statement not only for groups, but for any kind of structure.</p>

<p>The univalence axiom is inconsistent with proof irrelevence which is baked into Lean's logic. I think with parametricity theorems we may be able to prove this kind of result. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes Hölzl</span> might have to chime in to confirm.</p>

<p>Okay. But in general (without proof irrelevance), would it be possible in type theory to formulate/formalize statements such as<br>
"Isomorphic groups have the same (structural) properties."?<br>
Or are such statements rather meta properties?<br>
I guess that in ZFC, the above statement is not formalizable, because it is not possible to quantify over properties (let alone define what a <em>structural</em> property). So my hope is that the statement is formalizable in type theory, because in type theory, properties are mathematical objects. Also, in type theory, all properties are structural properties, I think.<br>
Please let me know if this is the wrong place to ask this question.</p>

<p>Here is a property of groups: let <code>G</code> be a group. My property for groups <code>H</code> is: <code>H = G</code>.<br>
This is true for the group <code>G</code>, but not in general for arbitary groups <code>H</code> that are merely isomorphic to <code>G</code>.</p>

<p>Yes, in HoTT you can easily prove  that isomorphic groups have the same properties. The formal statement could be something like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>∀(G H : Group), G ≅ H → ∀(P : G → Prop), P G ↔ P H
</pre></div>


<p>Note that <code>G</code> and <code>H</code> share all properties that can be expressed in the type theory. This might look a bit weird from a set-theoretic perspective: <code>G</code> and <code>H</code> could have different elements. However, in type theory you cannot really express that.</p>
<p>Aside: with <code>Prop</code> above I mean all types that have at most 1 element. You can replace <code>Prop</code> by <code>Type</code> and the statement would still be true.</p>

<p>I don't really have time right now to start playing with this Voevodsky stuff where you work in Coq and have this extra axiom. Is there a way of doing this sort of stuff in Lean 3? Lean 4?</p>

<p>I went out for a meal this week with a strong algebraist and I asked him to prove that if R and S were isomorphic rings and R was Gorenstein then S was Gorenstein and he simply did not know where to start. He said it was obvious.</p>

<p>Is there some sort of univalence conjecture that one can formalise in Lean? Stating that for all structures in a certain typeclass this basic property of "being the same" manages to permeate through -- the correct notion of equiv.</p>

<p>I don't know enough about Lean to formalise something like this, but I think cheeky way to circumvent this is start with the proposition above by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span> as the definition of isomorphic mathematical structures, rather than an axiom. However, I don't know that such a definition would lend itself to being useful to Lean.</p>

<p>Ask a research mathematician who doesn't know anything about schemes the following question: "Say X and Y are schemes, and X and Y are isomorphic. Say X is affine. Do you think Y is also affine?". They would answer "yeah, probably. "</p>

<p>Because schemes have a certain public interface which is mathematician-acceptable; there's a topological space, there's a functor from the open sets, but there's definitely no looking at elements of the topological space -- those are "unopenable sets" -- I think they're more like terms in type theory (terms that aren't types).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="218940">@Greg Conneen</span> : the problem with doing that is Lean is that you will never be able to prove that two structures are isomorphic (except in very trivial cases). You won't be able to show that the free group on 1 generator and <code>(ℤ,+)</code> are isomorphic. You would need some axiom like univalence for that.</p>

<p>To me, this looks like first order logic statements about a structure. Assume you have a structure together with some language (in rings, this would be constants <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> and addition and multiplication). Then any proposition expressed solely in this language (with forall and exists quantifiers, and negation, and free variables, and so on), if true in a ring, is true in any isomorphic ring. The proof is completely algorithmic (push everything by your isomorphism, by induction over the length of the formula). This is a weaker notion than isomorphism, in general (really deep theorem: in the language of groups, the free groups over 2 generators and 3 generators satisfy exactly the same formulas -- but ℤ^2 and ℤ^3 don't, it is a nice exercise to find a formula distinguishing the two). </p>
<p>If you allow yourself more words in your language (such as <code>∈</code>, or subsets, or things like that), then you can express more statements. But again everything is clearly invariant under isomorphism (and algorithmic, there is nothing mathematically hard in there). I don't see why there couldn't be a completely general tactic to push first-order statements by isomorphisms of the language under consideration, but since writing a transfer tactic is apparently hard I am certainly underestimating the difficulty.</p>

<p>Well, univalence allows you to prove that there are two proofs of a certain equality that are unequal (for example, you can prove this for <code>bool = bool</code>, but that is not important for now). In Lean, any two proofs of an equality are definitionally equal (because they are proofs of a <code>Prop</code>), so stating univalence naively for <code>eq</code> in Lean will be inconsistent...</p>

<p>One thing you might try is define a new inductive type:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>inductive hott_eq {α : Type u} (a : α) : α → Type
| refl : hott_eq a
</pre></div>


<p>It is <em>exactly</em> the same as <code>eq</code>, except that it lives in <code>Type</code> instead of <code>Prop</code>. Since it lives in type, proof irrelevance doesn't apply to it, so this should be consistent with univalence, right? <br>
Alas, assuming univalence for this <code>hott_eq</code> is also inconsistent in Lean. The fact that you have a proof-irrelevant <code>eq</code> living in <code>Prop</code> lying around, allows you to prove that <code>eq</code> and <code>hott_eq</code> are equivalent (i.e. <code>a = a'</code> is in bijection with <code>hott_eq a a'</code> for all <code>a</code>, <code>a'</code>). So you can prove that <code>hott_eq a a'</code> is also a subsingleton. So univalence is also inconsistent for that.</p>

<p>In first order logic, <code>x \in V</code> does not make sense as <code>x</code> is not part of the language you are allowing yourself currently, i.e., the language of vector spaces (with addition, 0, scalar multiplication and so on).</p>

<p>Actually, I do wonder whether I need the terms at all. I could just define a linear map to be a function from V to W that commuted with all the structure. I don't even need the terms. The identity element is just a map from unit to V. And don't get me started with punit -- we like to use unit. And everything can be in Type because we have a clever way of doing category theory called "proper classes", and it honestly all works because sometimes Brian Conrad or Peter Scholze all check.</p>

<p>Let me explain what is the first order logic of a structure. You have some symbols, and you are only allowed to write formulas using these symbols and quantifiers and free variables. For instance, in the language of groups (with multiplication, neutral element and inverses), you can write the formula <code>∃x, ∀y, ∃z, y=z*z ∨ y = z*z*x</code>. It is true in some groups, and not true in some other groups (this one is true in ℤ but not in ℤ^2, for instance). I claim that if such a formula is true in a group, it is obviously true in an isomorphic group (induction over the length of the formula, this is completely algorithmic). And this is not specific at all to groups: whatever structure with some language, isomorphisms will respect true formulas. You can add to your language more symbols such as <code>∈</code>, or <code>⊆</code> and then you can express more statements but that they are still all respected with any notion of isomorphism. </p>
<p>Most mathematical statements can be expressed as first order statements of the structure under consideration if you allow yourself the right language. And with this point of view isomorphism invariance is obvious for all these statements.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  I think deciding which parts of the implementation of a certain structure are allowed to be "used / unfolded" within a theory and which aren't, can't only be decided syntactically. What you are describing, is to my mind the human intelligence to have a higher level model of a structure apart from its technical implementation (the reals as a continuum, not as Dedekind cuts / equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences; this is also the reason why people rarely prove that different implementations of an idea are in fact equivalent).<br>
There have been several attempts at trying to make the term "within the scope of a theory / respecting a theory" precise.<br>
First order model theory, as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> describes, defines a language for a structure; isomorphism is then what is compatible with all parts of the language.<br>
Category theory allows us to create an abstract notion of morphism and says that valid constructions are only those which respect isomorphisms (in the sense of morphisms with a two-sided inverse).<br>
I think it is because we check definitions for their compatibility with a theory that we consider the question "is a scheme which is isomorphic to an affine scheme affine?" tautological. But this already assumes "affine-ness" to be well-defined with respect to the theory of schemes.</p>

<p>Here's a basic thing I don't understand. If I see the definition of a ring in Lean, I can correctly guess the definition of a homomorphism of rings, and as a consequence guess the definition of isomorphism. If I see the definition of a topological space, I cannot guess the definition of morphism (i.e. a computer can't) because there are two choices. If I see the definition of a partial order again there seem to be two choices: either <code>a &lt; b -&gt; f a &lt; f b</code> or <code>a &lt; b &lt;-&gt; f a &lt; f b</code>. Both might be used in mathematics. But I can guess what an isomorphism is, and miraculously this <em>canonical</em> notion of isomorphism is independent of the choice I made for my morphisms. Some stuff is happening automatically and some stuff isn't. Oh! Is it not a typeclass but some sort of weird new tag controlled by a machine? Is this the hold-up? It has to be tags so it's fiddly as hell and most of us can't do it? I can't have a "mathematician-approved for isomorphisms" Prop-valued tag?</p>

<p>This one is hard to express in first-order logic as it is quantifying over all A-modules. To me, it is not obvious even from a mathematical point of view. Think of a ring R in some universe u, and some other ring S in some universe v, which are isomorphic. Maybe it is possible to construct in universe v some S-module which has no analogue in universe u (maybe because its cardinality is larger than any set in universe u), and this S-module is precisely the one that plays a role in the definition.</p>

<p>I think a better example schemes. Let's do them. How do you express schemes in first order logic? A scheme is a topological space equipped with a functor from some (small) category made from the open sets to the (large) category of rings, plus some axioms that need not concern us but which I can assure you can be written in maths mode.</p>

<p>Okay I understand what you are saying. But then if I think about two different foundational systems for mathematics, the associated groupoids of a structure can be "different" (whatever that means). From a metamathematical point of view, asking about how the groupoid looks is not well-defined. Hence the decision for the univalence axiom to compress it as much as possible (to the hott_eq groupoid).</p>

<p>It depends on the language you are allowing. Second order statements are first order for an extended language. A first order statement in the classical sense is: <code>∃x, ∀y, ∃z, y=z*z ∨ y = z*z*x</code>. A second order statement in the classical sense, which becomes first order if you allow quantification over sets, is the following: there is a finite subset that generates the group (written suitably with quantifiers).</p>

<p>I agree with Fabian that the <em>meaning</em> of "predicate on rings" is that it is a predicate that respects ring isomorphism. There is a generic mechanism for producing isomorphisms (not homomorphisms) on first order structures, and I believe it extends to higher order as well (so that topologies are also applicable and so on). I think it's best to define these manually though, since we care how it's expressed.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate an example Chris gave, which demonstrates the important fact that some structure preserving predicates contain subterms that are not structure preserving. <code>dim V</code> is the cardinality of a basis of V. This is a structure preserving predicate, but the reason this is a deep proof is because it is formed out of a non-structure preserving function "a basis of V" (i.e. <code>choice (exists basis of V)</code>). An arbitrary vector space isomorphism will not take <code>choice (exists basis of V)</code> to <code>choice (exists basis of W)</code>, because there is no connection between these bases (unless V = W in lean). There is a particular isomorphism that preserves this, but that's not what a "vector space property" means.</p>

<p>If you define "dimension" as the maximal cardinality of an independent subset, yes, <code>rfl++</code> should prove it. If you defined it as "take the cardinality of some random basis", then the statement that is is invariant under isomorphism is non-trivial.</p>

<p>it relies on "I am isomorphism invariant" tags to build such proofs for first order statements (like other properties you want this tag on)</p>

<p>The problem is not that <code>transfer</code> doesn't work, it's that nothing has these tags right now so <code>transfer</code> doesn't know what to do</p>

<p>The mathematician in me wants to say that it is a theorem that the max cardinality of an independent subset is equal to the cardinality of a random basis, and I appreciate that this needs to be proved in a good API. However my point is simply that <em>however</em> the definition of dimension is made in Lean, a good API should have the result that it is isomorphism-invariant. Does this make people more inclined towards one definition than the other?</p>

<p>I definitely prefer the definition as the maximal cardinality of a linearly independent subset, as it is obviously isomorphism-invariant, contrary to the definition "take the cardinality of a basis found using choice".</p>

<p>Do you have the same problem deep down though, since "cardinals have supremums" is presumably proven with choice?</p>

<p>Even if some choice is involved, it will be the same choice over both sides of the isomorphism, i.e., choice over the same set of cardinals. Hence, it should give the same result (choice is an unpredictable but deterministic function: give it the same argument, it will give the same conclusion). At least if you don't change universes.</p>

<p>I'm happy not to change universes. Mathematicians don't really need universes for most of what we do.</p>
