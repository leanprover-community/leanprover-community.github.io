<p>Hi everyone! Jasmin Blanchette has asked me to spread this message to the crowd here.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lean Forward (<a href="https://lean-forward.github.io" target="_blank" title="https://lean-forward.github.io">https://lean-forward.github.io</a>) is an ambitious research project that aims at formally proving theorems in research mathematics and to address the main usability issues hampering the adoption of proof assistants in mathematical circles, by collaborating with number theorists. The project is funded by an NWO Vidi grant from January 2019 to December 2023 and is hosted by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>
<p>As part of this project, we will develop formal libraries of fundamental number theory in Lean and explore how to automate proof search in these. Moreover, we will develop techniques and tools that help mathematicians perform accurate computations and reasoning using proof assistants, integrating procedures from computer algebra systems in a foundational, verified fashion. The ultimate aim is to contribute to the development of a proof assistant that actually helps mathematicians by making them more productive and more confident in their results.</p>
<p>We are looking for outstanding candidates for several fully funded, four-year PhD positions, due to start in 2019 or early 2020. Candidates should ideally have some experience with (automatic or interactive) theorem proving or mathematics and be at ease with both theory and engineering. Please contact me for more information.</p>
