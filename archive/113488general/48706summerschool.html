<p>Friends,</p>
<p>Every summer, the Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University offers a three-week summer school for undergraduates. It focuses on topics at the intersection between philosophy and the sciences, such as logic, statistics, linguistics, and so on. </p>
<p>This year, it will be held June 3-21, and I'll be introducing students to interactive theorem proving and Lean in the first week:</p>

<p>Please share this information with any students who may be interested.</p>

<p>As someone who attended this summer school (a long time ago): it's great, and very worthwhile!</p>
