<p>"Undead" is a game from [Simon Tatham's portable puzzle collection] (<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/" target="_blank" title="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/">https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/</a>). These games are perfect information one player puzzle games, and often solving a level completely (for me at least, in most of these games) involves finding a constructive proof that there is precisely one solution to the level. I'm probably going to supervise a masters project this coming academic year on games like this, so I thought it was about time I understood what I could do with them in Lean.</p>
<p>Here's a [pic of an undead level] (<a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/blog/undead_initial.png" target="_blank" title="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/blog/undead_initial.png">http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/blog/undead_initial.png</a>). The diagonal lines in some squares are (two-sided) mirrors. The vacant squares need to be each filled with exactly one of a vampire, ghost or zombie. There are 9 vacant squares and we're told at the top that we need to fill them with three ghosts, three vampires and three zombies. The numbers around the outside of the board are the number of monsters you can see if you look into the board from where the number is, with the caveat that you can't see a ghost directly and you can't see a vampire through a mirror. So for example, the zero on the top row, second from the left, indicates that you can't see the monster in the top left hand corner through a mirror, so it must be a vampire, and the 3 at the left of the top row indicates that exactly one of the monsters in the first column is a ghost (because you can only see three of the four monsters in that column).</p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/blog/undead_initial.png" target="_blank" title="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/blog/undead_initial.png"><img src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/92ef1384545d96f90cc96adcb994bdac8caeb2a5/687474703a2f2f777777662e696d70657269616c2e61632e756b2f7e62757a7a6172642f78656e612f626c6f672f756e646561645f696e697469616c2e706e67"></a></div><p>This sort of game is really easy to model in Lean; like mathematics, it seems to fit very gracefully into the language of dependent type theory. The nine empty squares can be thought of as 9 variables of type <code>square</code> (or type <code>monster</code> or whatever), the 16 numbers and three totals give 19 equations involving these variables, and the two main claims here are (1) that there's a solution to the equations and (2) it's unique.</p>
<p>Here is a formalisation of the level in Lean, plus some preliminary lemmas.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/kbuzzard/53712d672a894d7b158a512f7aa5f836" target="_blank" title="https://gist.github.com/kbuzzard/53712d672a894d7b158a512f7aa5f836">https://gist.github.com/kbuzzard/53712d672a894d7b158a512f7aa5f836</a></p>
<p>The lemmas reduce the problem to the following position:</p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/blog/undead.png" target="_blank" title="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/blog/undead.png"><img src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/1d14fa6dc9bea88e32196efc36215e0269995eb3/687474703a2f2f777777662e696d70657269616c2e61632e756b2f7e62757a7a6172642f78656e612f626c6f672f756e646561642e706e67"></a></div><p>(and actually a little further because I worked out something about a7 after taking that screenshot). The search space initially has size 3^9, which is a bit big perhaps for Lean, but the lemmas I prove about the solution reduce the space to something like 2^7 * 3, which sounds a bit more reasonable. I think I'd now like to brute force it and get a proof that there's a unique solution, plus a description of the solution, but I'm not sure how to do that in Lean. I have these random facts like "variable a6 isn't a vampire" but I am not sure how to write the procedural code in Lean which will save me from generating a gazillion cases with a6 being a vampire. The issue is that I want to do cases on all 8 remaining variables at once, but for the variables where I've proved something I want to immediately eliminate all cases which contradict what I've proved. Am I making sense? I just want to solve the level now, in Lean, without running out of memory, and ideally I'd like to output the solution. I feel like I've done the lion's share of the work now but I've not quite finished.</p>

<p>Maybe that note will also help me remember the syntax. I don't use it very often, so I have to keep looking for it. But if I know that it's an attribute, I know it must be in <code>@[...]</code>.</p>

<p>I'm working on square 7. After the line <code>  cases a₂;cases a₃;cases a₅;cases h₇;cases h₁₅,</code> in tactic mode, it's difficult for me to see what happened. Each of the a's has three possibilities, so after the three cases tactics there are now 27 goals. But for most of them (I think) there is a contradiction with assumptions h7 and h15, so after that entire line is processed we are back to one goal (unless I have misunderstood Lean's output). However I don't seem to be able to read off which of the cases we are in. Is there a trick for me to track which of the 27 branches survived?</p>

<p>Actually I am now confused about whether I have even done what I think I've done. Is this a bug? What happens if you type this into a Lean file:</p>

<span class="kn">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and then put your cursor just after the end comma in the <code>cases a;cases b,</code> line? I expect to see 9 goals but I only see one. Typing "sorry" makes the next one appear :-) Typing a few sorries eventually sorts things out and then it's back to 9 goals.</p>

<p>I think the <code>;</code> just messes up the information on the current line.  If you put <code>skip,</code> on another line it shows the expected number of goals.</p>

<p>Information about the goal is stored in a very unstructured form at the moment: essentially there is a function <code>tactic.save_info</code> which stores the corresponding string at a user-specified position (= line/column pair, and yes this can be almost anywhere..).</p>

<p>If you put <code>skip</code> then on the line <em>before</em> the <code>skip</code> it displays correctly. So perhaps it's the second semicolon which is causing the confusion.</p>

<p>Yes, the semicolon seems to break the goal output between the surrounding commas.  If you add a <code>skip,</code> then you add a comma which keeps the breakage away.</p>

<p>Here's an example of an intermediate goal that you have to prove when proving the exists_unique statement above:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>y : ℕ,
h : ∃ (x : ℕ), 0 + y + x = 0 ∧ ∀ (y_1 : ℕ), 0 + y + y_1 = 0 → y_1 = x
⊢ y = 0

<blockquote>
<p>Description: An alternate definition of double existential uniqueness (see 2eu4 2371). A mistake sometimes made in the literature is to use ∃!𝑥∃!𝑦 to mean "exactly one 𝑥 and exactly one 𝑦." (For example, see Proposition 7.53 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 53.) It turns out that this is actually a weaker assertion, as can be seen by expanding out the formal definitions. This theorem shows that the erroneous definition can be repaired by conjoining ∀𝑥∃* 𝑦𝜑 as an additional condition. The correct definition apparently has never been published. (∃* means "exists at most one.")</p>

<p>no, they are not logically equivalent</p>

<p>frankly the problem is that <code>∃!</code> is a shitty binder notation</p>

<p>So in fact the thing I'm trying to prove with this undead thing is not even formulated correctly.</p>

<p>like I said, the easy way to say this without having to think much is to use exists unique in a pair type</p>

<p>I don't care what Lean thinks <code>∃!</code> means. All I want to say is that there exists a unique 9-tuple with some property, and I've just realised that I'd better spell it out rather than using this terrifying notation.</p>

<p>I wonder if any of the mathematicians here can find a mathematician who thinks <code>∃! a b, p a b</code> means anything other than what I suggested it meant above with that false lemma.</p>

<p>I see. The reason this has happened is that Lean has one inbuilt system for dealing with multiple variables with one binder, and to put it bluntly it doesn't work with this one, so really perhaps a different system should be used for this one binder and that might be what Sebastian was saying. Maybe I've caught up at last.</p>

<p>Most mathematicians think ∃! a b, p a b means what you wrote. They also think that ∃! a, ∃! b, p a b encodes this statement, and they are wrong</p>

<p>it is obvious once you give it more than a cursory examination, but it's one of those things that often escapes notice</p>

<p>I don't think I'd ever even considered the concept <code>∃! a, ∃! b, p a b</code> until this evening and I suspect that many mathematicians would also not have come across it. It looks very weird to me. Of course, hindsight is a wonderful thing...</p>
