<p>I have always been confused about dot notation. I don't use it as much as other people, because I don't understand it as well as other people. I've read <a href="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/mathlib/blob/e5aad2e4e0964c7624183efdb534878b6a06bbb5/docs/extras/structures.md#about-the-namespace-shortcut" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/mathlib/blob/e5aad2e4e0964c7624183efdb534878b6a06bbb5/docs/extras/structures.md#about-the-namespace-shortcut">Patrick's notes</a> on this and TPIL but I think there's more to it.</p>
<p>I understand that if I make a new structure <code>structure point (α : Type) := (x : α) (y : α)</code> then for <code>p : point</code> I can use <code>p.x</code> instead of <code>point.x p</code>. I also understand that if we make more functions in the structure's namespace like <code>point.blah</code> (which for simplicity takes as input one point and possibly some other stuff) then <code>p.blah</code> is shorthand for <code>point.blah p</code> (or perhaps <code>point.blah _ _ p</code> if the point happens not to be the first thing that <code>point.blah</code> eats). </p>
<p>What threw me yesterday when working on the perfectoid project was that my proof that if <code>neg</code> was a continuous function on a topological ring then it was also a continuous function on a subring looked like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">continuous_neg</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">continuous_subtype_mk</span> <span class="bp">_</span> <span class="err">$</span>
                    <span class="n">continuous</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">comp</span>
                      <span class="n">continuous_subtype_val</span> <span class="err">$</span>
                      <span class="n">topological_ring</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">continuous_neg</span> <span class="n">A</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and then Patrick took one look at this code and pointed out that this could be written</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">continuous_neg</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">continuous_subtype_mk</span> <span class="bp">_</span> <span class="err">$</span>
                      <span class="n">continuous_subtype_val</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">comp</span> <span class="err">$</span>
                      <span class="n">topological_ring</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">continuous_neg</span> <span class="n">A</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It took me a while to realise that he wasn't talking about some fancy new function in the topology directory in mathlib but was in fact advocating the use of the dot notation. It would never have occurred to me to try to use dot notation here. In the examples above, which I understand, we have <code>p : point</code>, i.e. a term whose type is a structure and then a function in the corresponding namespace. But here <code>continuous_subtype_val</code> has type <code>∀ {α : Type u} [_inst_1 : topological_space α] {p : α → Prop}, continuous subtype.val</code> which is definitely not a structure, and even if I remove all the implicit arguments then it becomes <code>continuous subtype.val</code> which is also not a structure, and even if I look at the head function then it's <code>continuous</code> which is also not a structure. But Patrick's code does work. I am fast coming to the conclusion that my understanding of dot notation is nowhere near complete.</p>
<p>Investigating further, I find that <code>#check continuous_subtype_val.comp</code> works, even though there appears to be no function <code>continuous_subtype_val.comp</code>. Moreover, this seems to have nothing to do with structures at all, because <code>continuous</code> is not a structure, it's just a plain old definition. What seems to be going on in this situation is that if <code>p</code> has type <code>{implicit stuff} [more implicit stuff] foo x</code> and <code>foo</code> happens coincidentally to be both a function and a namespace (which is something that <code>continuous</code> seems to be, for some reason I don't understand) then <code>p.blah</code> is defined to mean <code>foo.blah p</code> . In some sense I am surprised that this is ever useful beyond the case I understand, i.e. structures. If <code>continuous_subtype_val</code> had happened to just take one explicit argument, which in a parallel universe it could have done, I am assuming that this trick would stop working.</p>
<p>So is the philosophy something like "if <code>foo</code> is any old function, and if I'm defining a function <code>f : foo x -&gt; y</code>, then I might want to consider calling the function <code>foo.f</code>because then I can write <code>f.p</code> if <code>p : foo x</code>? What I don't get is that if I had just called it <code>f</code> then I could have written <code>f p</code> which is just as many characters as <code>f.p</code> anyway. </p>
<p>I guess I can understand that if <code>foo</code> is a structure and I wanted to define a <code>neg</code> on <code>foo x</code> then I would instinctively called it <code>foo.neg</code>. But I wouldn't do this for <code>continuous</code>. Is this evidence that <code>continuous</code> should be a structure? Are our naming conventions treating it like it is one?</p>

<p>To spell it out, the full semantics of dot notation is, roughly, "if <code>e</code> is a <em>term</em> of type <code>t ...</code>, and there is a function <code>t.f</code>, then <code>e.f ...</code> is syntax sugar for <code>t.f ... e ...</code>, where <code>e</code> has been inserted as the argument for the first parameter of type <code>t ...</code>". <code>e</code> being a variable of a structure <code>s</code> and <code>s.f</code> being a projection is just a special case of that.</p>

<p>Note that the <em>term</em> <code>continuous_subtype_val</code> has type <code>continuous subtyp.val</code>. The type you gave is the type of <code>@continuous_subtype_val</code>! So dot notation doesn't think "oh, this is a function", but "oh, this is a <code>continuous</code>"</p>

<p>Originally, <code>continuous.comp</code> was called <code>continuous_comp</code>. It was renamed because it is "eligible" for projection notation like this</p>

<p>You can't just call it <code>comp</code> because that overlaps with a million other things</p>

<p>There is a danger in using non-structures with projection notation, because regular defs can be unfolded, and once they are unfolded they no longer have that name anymore (<code>continuous</code> in this case) so the projections won't find the namespace. In practice I haven't had too much issue with this unless you are solving some weird unification problem</p>

<p><code>continuous.comp</code> was "eligible" because it took <code>continuous f</code> as an input. It seems to me that the real coincidence is that <code>continuous_subtype_val</code> has type <code>continuous ...</code> and every other input can be inferred.</p>

<p>it's not a coincidence that <code>continuous_subtype_val</code> returns a <code>continuous</code>; that's the whole point of the function, we are proving things are continuous. Possibly some hypotheses would be necessary but those can be dealt with as above</p>

<p>Ok I think I now understand. Thanks to Sebastian and Mario as ever. Would I be right in thinking that the complete list of functions that aren't structures but which have an associated namespace is quite small? <code>continuous</code> being one. Or does this happen everywhere and I've just not noticed it yet (and this is the reason I underuse dot notation)?</p>

<p>You can basically always use <code>continuous.comp</code> with projection notation, because the first argument will be a <code>continuous</code></p>

<p>it's a pretty simple and common trick, enough that I can't say how many times it's been used in mathlib. If a theorem about <code>foo</code> things has an argument of type <code>foo x</code>, you should consider calling it <code>foo.bar</code> instead of <code>foo_bar</code></p>

<p>I guess we can still define <code>continuous.o</code> with arguments in the right order...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it's a pretty simple and common trick, enough that I can't say how many times it's been used in mathlib. If a theorem about <code>foo</code> things has an argument of type <code>foo x</code>, you should consider calling it <code>foo.bar</code> instead of <code>foo_bar</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crucial point is that the function has as _input_ things of type <code>foo</code>, like <code>continuous.comp</code>, rather than just outputting things of type <code>foo</code> like <code>continuous_subtype_val</code>. Dots for the input, underscores for the output.</p>

<p>So both the theorem and the lemma are in the <code>isometry_on</code> namespace and  have an input of type <code>isometry_on ...</code>, so dot notation is appropriate. </p>
<p>I guess what happens in practice is that users of a particular theory instinctively know which functions this works for, and use it.  I guess we can also infer from this example that there are theorems <code>uniform_embedding.embedding : uniform_embedding f -&gt; embedding f</code> and <code>embedding.continuous : embedding f -&gt; continuous f</code>. I think understand this properly now; thanks for posting the example, it is very neat. The example shows that the concept seems to concatenate in good cases (when there's only one input, unlike <code>continuous.comp</code> which takes two).</p>

<p>well, like I said, it still works in the n-ary case, you just have to put parentheses</p>

<p>but this kind of "dot-chaining" is exactly what projections are great at. It's intentionally similar to method chaining in OO languages like Java</p>

<p><code>f.x</code> is called projection notation, <code>foo.x</code> is a projection on <code>f</code></p>

<p>in a structure, the fields are also called projections - the origin is the first and second projections of a pair</p>
