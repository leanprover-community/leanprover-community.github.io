<p>Thought this was worth its own topic because we all know there are people here who are less interested in the maths side of things. Here's an update.</p>

<p>Kenny and I nearly have schemes. Not in a "just about ready for mathlib" sort of way -- far from it -- but in a "the mathematically correct definition" sort of way.</p>

<p>It will need a lot more work before it goes anywhere near mathlib, but I am not going to do that work quite yet because for deadline reasons it would be nice to get perfectoid spaces before 10th March, or at least to get some way towards them. After that we can think about tidying up and deciding which bits mathlib might want and in what form.</p>

<p>The reason I'm posting is because I need to make a call on categories. At the end of the day I currently need sheaves of commutative rings (for the _definition_ of a scheme), and to actually prove anything at all I need sheaves of modules for these rings. For perfectoid spaces I will need sheaves of topological rings on a site.</p>

<p>So do I go with sheaves taking values in categories or do I just muddle on?</p>

<p>If I go with sheaves taking values in categories then to put it bluntly it simply raises the bar even higher to getting anything in to mathlib.</p>

<p>Here's a question: what is the least common denominator of all the things you need sheaves of?</p>

<h4><a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/stacks%20project%20/%20schemes/near/123082099" class="zl"><img src="https://leanprover-community.github.io/assets/img/zulip2.png" alt="view this post on Zulip"></a> <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/113488general/35992stacksprojectschemes.html#123082099">Mario Carneiro (Feb 28 2018 at 09:20)</a>:</h4>
<p>My hope is that it is at least a concrete category</p>

<p>If you project needing 3+ different kinds of sheaves, that's sufficient for making a single generalization, but it's not immediate that this generalization should be over categories in the usual sense</p>

<p>But this has always been an independent experiment for me -- can we actually even define a scheme / perfectoid space in Lean? For me that is an interesting independent question. I don't think it is for Mario, because he looks at maths very differently and, not unreasonably, I don't think he can tell the difference between a perfectoid space and a topological space in some sense -- they're both structures with a bunch of axioms to him. And for some reason he seems very much focussed on theorems rather than definitions -- a theorem for him is proof that the definition works, whereas if I know as a mathematician that a definition is correct then for me that might be enough.</p>

<p>So there is certainly the possibility that my conclusion is "look, here's a definition" and Mario's response is "who cares?". And the definition might just then sit there for months just being something that mathematicians can look and go "oh look what they can do now, how fancy, that's a million miles from the odd order theorem isn't it".</p>

<p>I think you are right in that assessment. It seems to me obvious that one can make a definition of scheme / perfectoid space in lean; that's obviously within Lean's capabilities. The question is only if one can make a good or useful definition</p>

<p>For them you ideally would have sheaves on a more general object than a topological space and then take the derived category.</p>

<p>No, that's just one question. Another question is how to get mathematicians talking about Lean. And we already have ample evidence that proving a theorem which is 400 pages of ingenious but relatively straightforward calculations in group theory and which was done by mathematicians before all of us were born, does not do it. But in the math community there is huge excitement about perfectoid spaces because they are new and they are demolishing bits of the Langlands Programme which people thought were hitherto inaccessible. They are <em>fashionable</em>.</p>

<p>I assume that perfectoid spaces are not themselves the object of perfectoid theory, such as it is. Presumably they are being used in some way to get things done, some proof strategy that harnesses the power of the definition</p>

<p>It leaves me genuinely uncertain about the best path. I think you're fundamentally right in wanting to make a dash towards an important and impressive part of modern mathematics. I agree with everything you say concerning the odd order theorem. (The initial human proof of the odd order theorem was in some ways a huge disappointment --- it was one of the first times humans encountered an interesting theorem whose shortest proof was really long. Saying that computers are helpful for doing tedious mathematics is not really a selling point.)</p>

<p>But I'm also pretty sceptical that the March 11 dash you have in mind is going to have much effect. It's too likely that the code will fall apart quickly afterwards, or otherwise be unusable because it was written hurriedly.</p>

<p>I would like it to have an effect --- what we should dream about is a "mathoverflow effect", whereby one day a new thing appeared in the world that everyone realised they'd always wanted. I think there are potentially a huge number of students out there who would be interested in contributing to Lean libraries. However in combination with any "publicity", we would also need to have better strategy in place for teaching them how to work in Lean, and to productively organise their work. The current Lean community is realistically not yet ready for either of those.</p>

<p>Also, I'm still a little proud of how few proofs I have in my library (i.e. how many are proved by <code>obviously</code> with little or no human intervention). :-)</p>

<p>Oh -- and in some interesting news -- two mathematicians here at ANU, after coming to my undergraduate students' talks (on implementing Euclidean domains, and the first iso theorem for groups), said they were going home to install Lean over the weekend. There's hope. :-)</p>

<p>I would like it to have an effect --- what we should dream about is a "mathoverflow effect", whereby one day a new thing appeared in the world that everyone realised they'd always wanted. I think there are potentially a huge number of students out there who would be interested in contributing to Lean libraries. However in combination with any "publicity", we would also need to have better strategy in place for teaching them how to work in Lean, and to productively organise their work. The current Lean community is realistically not yet ready for either of those.</p>

<p>I am going to dedicate a lot of time over the summer to writing documentation for undergraduate mathematicians introducing them to how to use Lean via my introduction to proof course.</p>

<p>Ha ha! I was of course taking a very extreme viewpoint which I do not 100% believe in myself. I just wanted to highlight some of the obvious differences between defining a perfectoid space and proving the odd order theorem, even though "they're both computer programs".</p>

<p>I agree that the fact that it was possible to write down a formal proof of the odd order theorem only demonstrates that proof assistants can be used to represent good old undergraduate level algebra. Not that proof assistants are useful tools for research in mathematics.</p>

<p>My hope is that one day proof assistants will be useful to discover new stuff, because the computer can in principle help you play with  the definitions, discover abstractions and test them. So yes, I agree, it would be really cool to have the definition of a perfectoid formalized, because then one could play with it interactively instead of staring at a paper definition like a fish out of water.</p>

<p>But then I am not sure that the main problem is to come up with a definition which is not usable. I would say that the problem would be to formalize what  a cat  is and then to call it a perfectoid. Specially if not many people both know what a perfectoid is and how to speak/read Lean.<br>
Lean checks proofs but only human readers check the definitions.  So a collection of theorems, and of convincing examples, helps this assessment.</p>

<p>As a regular reviewer of papers about formalized mathematics, I  often read papers which claim to formalize the theory of mystuffoids, it is very interesting and the authors prove a litany of lemmas, culminating with the Fundamental Theorem of Mystuffoids. But the authors never provide a (formalized) instance of mystuffoid. So as a reviewer, I try to verify that all the elementary examples of mystuffoids I know of can indeed by equipped with the structure provided by the authors. And that a few things that are not stuffoids for a good reason will not be instances. I had myself issues with my own tentative formal definitions at several occasions, and rejected several papers because this protocole made explicit flaws in the definitions.</p>

<p>Listen. I am in this unique position in that I get to give a lot of talks about a lot of random things to lots of people most of whom are under the age of 20 and some of whom are extremely smart. I am personally, after many conversations (and I'm sure Patrick feels the same way) no longer really interested in telling research mathematicians about formal theorem provers, because generally they are not interested. But on the other hand undergraduates are interested, and if you train them right they can really do stuff. Chris Hughes is answering other people's questions on this chat now and we all know what Kenny has done. There are other people "bubbling under" in my Thursday evening meetings and I'll train them up too. Remember that when those undergraduates started coming to my club I could not even use the software. I could not prove 2+2=4 in the reals, and nobody could prove anything about the complexes because there were no complexes. And yet a few people stuck around and are doing interesting things. Next year I am going to be a lot better and let's see what happens. But back to this conference. I think that if you're a smart 20 year old and you come to my talk on the 11th at some undergrad pure maths conference to learn about perfectoid spaces and then you hear me say that I've defined them in Lean and if you want to learn about Lean then you might want to try proving lemma 1 about them, then there is a chance that you will get curious and try. I do think there's a chance. And if you fail, which of course you might well, then you might instead want to try some of the easier lessons on my blog. And then you might get addicted, like I did and like Chris did. So I am going to continue going round the South East of the UK telling undergrads and schoolkids about Lean because there are random smart people out there who are bored at uni and who might actually want to goof around with trendy objects in a theorem prover. Maybe. I am genuinely trying to piggy back on the trendiness of the topic. I've written a paper about perfectoid spaces so I do have an excuse to talk about them, why shouldn't I tag Lean on and see what happens? I want to push undergraduates -- who don't know any better -- to start investigating theorem provers, because I think they're the future of pure mathematics and I think that thus far the CS community has singularly failed to demonstrate this to the maths community. I am trying a new idea from a new perspective, purely for fun. I want to introduce them from the bottom up and I am prepared to try lots of angles, and for me perfectoid spaces is definitely an angle worth trying. I want to try 10 different things and this is one.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="sean.leather@gmail.com" data-user-id="110045">@Sean Leather</span>  I thought about your comment a bit more and it's more complicated than I first imagined. Somehow examples and lemmas all get mixed together in this game, and definitions too. It's a bit strange. I said to Mario earlier "for you there is no difference between a perfectoid space and a group, they're both just structures" but somehow this isn't right. A group really is just a structure defined by some axioms. For these more complex objects there are theorems that you need to prove before things even make sense. For example you sometimes want to say "and my structure has an X, and if we choose a generator f of X then f also has property Y" or maybe even "and for all generators f of X, f also has property Y" but then if you actually want to get anywhere you need some lemma to say that all X's have generators, or maybe even that one generator of X has property Y iff they all do. Either you prove these lemmas or you don't. If you don't (and there are going to be a couple of times with schemes where I propose not proving the lemmas just yet) then it really would be impossible to give any examples at all because the lemmas are somehow part of the infrastructure. So perhaps I interpreted <span class="user-mention" data-user-email="assia.mahboubi@inria.fr" data-user-id="110172">@Assia Mahboubi</span> 's comments in a similar way to you but then went on and thought more about the consequences of constructing an example in the situation I had in mind, and realised that I was some genuine lemmas in algebraic geometry away from being able to give any example at all.</p>

<p>Kenny and I just finished the definition of a scheme.</p>

<p>It passes no basic tests whatsoever, other than "compiles" and "is mathematically correct".</p>

<p>In particular, for any commutative ring R we can build an affine scheme Spec(R), but we have not yet proved that this object is a scheme.</p>

<p>We are a couple of theorems away from this.</p>

<p>[the issue is that a scheme is a space with a sheaf, locally isomorphic to an affine scheme, but this isomorphism is an isomorphism of spaces with presheaves of rings (a morphism of sheaves is by definition a morphism of the underlying presheaves) so we do not logically need to check that the presheaf of rings that we have defined on Spec(R) is a sheaf]</p>
