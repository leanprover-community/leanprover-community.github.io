<p><em>This is broadly related to <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Adding.20Lean.20support.20to.20Codewars" title="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Adding.20Lean.20support.20to.20Codewars">Adding Lean Support to Codewars</a>, but this time I'm directly testing out on my PC instead of on Codewars' servers.</em></p>
<p>So suppose I create a Lean project as follows:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ leanpkg new my_project
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> my_project
$ leanpkg add leanprover-community/mathlib
</pre></div>


<p>I then remove <code>_target/deps/mathlib/src/</code> entirely and replace it with <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-nightly/releases/download/nightly-2020-02-17/mathlib-olean-nightly-2020-02-17.tar.gz" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-nightly/releases/download/nightly-2020-02-17/mathlib-olean-nightly-2020-02-17.tar.gz">nightly <code>.olean</code> files for mathlib</a>. Then, after that, I return to the command line:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ find _target <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="s2">&quot;[.]lean</span>$<span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> xargs rm <span class="c1"># Remove all .lean files from mathlib</span>
$ find _target <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="s2">&quot;[.]olean</span>$<span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> xargs touch <span class="c1"># Give same timestamp to all .olean files</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that the setup is complete, I go to <code>src/</code> in my project directory and create three files <code>Preloaded.lean</code>, <code>Solution.lean</code> and <code>SolutionTest.lean</code> of the following format:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/-</span><span class="cm"> Preloaded.lean -/</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">analysis</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">specific_limits</span> <span class="c1">-- Import something from mathlib</span>

<span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">SUBMISSION</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">some_mathematical_statement</span>
<span class="kn">notation</span> <span class="bp">`</span><span class="n">SUBMISSION</span><span class="bp">`</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">SUBMISSION</span> <span class="c1">-- cheat prevention; prevent override of SUBMISSION</span>

<span class="c">/-</span><span class="cm"> Solution.lean -/</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Preloaded</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">real</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">basic</span> <span class="c1">-- maybe import some more from mathlib</span>

<span class="c1">-- Solution likely uses some results from mathlib</span>
<span class="kn">theorem</span> <span class="n">solution</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">some_mathematical_statement</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">some_proof</span>

<span class="c">/-</span><span class="cm"> SolutionTest.lean -/</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Preloaded</span> <span class="n">Solution</span>

<span class="kn">theorem</span> <span class="n">submission</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">SUBMISSION</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">solution</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However, I get extremely slow performance when I run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ lean SolutionTest.lean -E SolutionTest.out --only-export<span class="o">=</span>submission <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> leanchecker SolutionTest.out submission
</pre></div>


<p>For example, doing this on a proof that <code>0.999... = 1</code> takes 1m30s on my machine when it should take only about 8 seconds. Even just compiling <code>SolutionTest.lean</code> as follows takes half a minute:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ lean SolutionTest.lean
</pre></div>


<p>Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong which is causing this subpar performance? I thought using pre-compiled <code>.olean</code> files (and deleting the original <code>.lean</code> files!) for mathlib should speed up the compilation process?</p>

<p>The community in general only started using versions of Lean after 3.4.2 this month, after well over a year of being fixed to 3.4.2, and not all of the tooling has caught up.</p>

<p>I am completely confused by your leanpkg.toml file. My leanpkg makes files with the line <code>lean_version = "3.4.2"</code> and in the projects which I have upgraded by hand to Lean 3.5.1, they say <code>lean_version = "leanprover-community/lean:3.5.1"</code>. I am not an expert in this side of things by any means. I've never seen a toml like yours before but it might be fine.</p>

<p>I went to the lean repository to find the link above and I'm really stunned: it seems lean3.6 was released yesterday without fixing this critical bug which prevents using the community Lean with leanpkg.</p>

<p>OK so basically the story is that there has been a community fork of Lean for a long time, but none of the tools used it. We decided earlier this month that it was time to now get users using the community fork, but some of the tools don't work correctly yet. I am using Lean 3.5.1 no problem with this toml:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>[package]
name = &quot;M4P33&quot;
version = &quot;0.1&quot;
lean_version = &quot;leanprover-community/lean:3.5.1&quot;
path = &quot;src&quot;

[dependencies]
mathlib = {git = &quot;https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib&quot;, rev = &quot;1b1b6
26ae32b9a23d4eeab59dd78e0f9b3ac594e&quot;}
</pre></div>


<p>so the first question is whether your problems are fixed by changing the toml so that <code>lean_version</code> is what it says above, and <code>mathlib</code> is set so that the revision is precisely the revision which you're checking out with the gzipped tarfile.</p>

<p>Presumably <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="264734">@Donald Sebastian Leung</span> is not using <code>elan</code>, otherwise he would have gotten an error using his <code>leanpkg.toml</code>.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="264734">@Donald Sebastian Leung</span> Does checking an <em>empty</em> Lean file take any significant time? If yes, it could be that Lean is recompiling its own core library. If no, then perhaps the 30s vs 8s checking time simply is a matter of different CPUs, esp. different number of cores.</p>

<p>IIRC from the previous topic, Kevin had an alternative proof that takes 1s, so I suppose the proof just isn't very optimized.</p>

<p>Final update: I went with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> 's suggestion and went with <code>elan</code> + compiling the mathlib myself (which I swear took at least 2 hours), and my <code>0.999... = 1</code> example took 1m45s to compile. At this point I can be certain that my Mac (and Codewars' servers as well) is simply too slow for Lean. Thank you for all your help and support, I think this thread (and the thread on adding Lean support to Codewars) can be closed now.</p>

<p>There is <em>something wrong</em>. No file this short takes 1m45s to compile. Your set-up is broken. Earlier on I pointed out that you were probably using incompatible Lean and mathlib somehow. All this talk of &gt; 30 seconds is completely absurd. Your set-up is broken right now. Nobody else reports this kind of time on any system, even Johan's old laptop.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="264734">@Donald Sebastian Leung</span> I compiled your proof in less than 8 seconds on old hardware. I strongly suspect that you are also compiling a large chunk of Lean's maths library in your tests. If you use VS Code on your mac and look at your proof compiling, where are the orange bars? If they stay at the top of the file for 1 minute then you are compiling mathlib. If they quickly move from the top of the file and then spend 1 minute on your code then you are right, your hardware is not quick enough. The big question is what is going on during that 1 minute. You want to be compiling your code. I strongly suspect you are compiling a large chunk of mathlib due to a bad set-up. I'm sorry the infrastructure is not there. Ironically if you had tried to do all this a month or so ago before Lean 3.5.1 appeared and added to the confusion then you might have found things easier. Right now our tools are bad and everything has to be done by hand. But your belief that your file plus a correctly compiled mathlib takes 1m45 to compile on a machine which is e.g. capable of running a web browser is absurd.</p>

<p>I wonder with the new mathlib tools (leanproject or whatever it will be called) if there could be a tool which lets one test that one's setup is complete, i.e. that it is using the .olean files, and that it compiles a file in a reasonable timeframe.  Then I think for cases like this, telling the user to run that command can be part of the debugging process (and maybe a final step in the setup instructions).</p>

<p>So it just occurred to me to ask: how can I find out if I'm recompiling the core library? If I do <code>lean --profile someFile.lean</code> and the compilation time in the cumulative profiling times is in the order of fractions of a millisecond then I suppose that that is not the case?</p>
