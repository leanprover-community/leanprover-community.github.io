<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> How can I recover the old behavior of <code>obviously</code> which did not trace the steps it took?<br>
Perhaps the replaceable thing ought to be called <code>cat_tactic</code> or something, and <code>obviously</code> should return to its old behavior?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>, I've silenced the trace messages from obviously.</p>

<p>Moreover, yesterday Mario and I overhauled tidy from top to bottom. The code is much shorter and saner now. :-)</p>

<p>OK so there is something annoying about <code>obviously</code>. I've now used the category theory library a fair bit so I can say it's (a) good at closing the goals it should be closing and (b) slow. I've seen it <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Ideal.20lemma/near/192137438" title="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Ideal.20lemma/near/192137438">take a minute to construct a tactic proof which runs in a second</a>. Is it possible to somehow completely "factor out" <code>obviously</code> in a safe way? I want to be able to import a compiled file <code>obviously.lean</code> whose data changes if I change a file containing <code>obviously</code> or something, and which contains certificates for all the goals that <code>obviously</code> closes (maybe as axioms or something). And then you can occasionally <code>obviously_check</code> your file where it actually uses the tactic to generate all the proofs. If I want to restart Lean for some reason when working on a file with lots of <code>obviously</code>s it's going to take some time, but Scott really doesn't want them visible to mathematicians because these goals really are obvious to mathematicians -- these are things a mathematician would not bother to justify in a blackboard lecture.</p>

<p>Can <code>obviously</code> say "Oh, you gave me this once before -- here's the answer I came up with last time and it worked fine. Do you want me to run it again? (y/N)"</p>

<p>This was all dreamed of before, but it requires deep changes to Lean. Maybe in Lean 4?</p>

<p>Keeley actually got exactly this to work in a (hacked) version of Lean 3... It's not that deep. He just needed fast io to a file.</p>

<p>in that case, we may be in luck since we're rebranding "hacking lean" as "lean development"</p>

<p>Oh.. Keeley has already merged his hacks. They're officially not hacks anymore. :-)</p>

<p>Let me see if I can run his tactic block caching trickery now.</p>

<p>Okay, it's shockingly easy to use. Checkout <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2300" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2300">#2300</a>, and add <code>import tactic.tcache.enable</code> at the top of one of your files, and magically everything appears to compile faster.</p>

<p>(There's a bug: <code>by X; Y</code> blocks seem to make it choke.)</p>
