<p>What is a typeclass diamond (note : this has nothing to do with Scholze's diamonds, it's an unfortunate name-clash)? I think it's something like the above link. Two distinct instance routes from A to D, with typeclass inference giving us two terms of type D which are provably distinct. I am assuming that the system should be regarded as having failed at this point. How much can I get away with? I think there are other lower category diamonds as well though, right? What other things can go wrong? Instances which are equal but not computably equal? Instances which are equal but not definitionally equal? Is there some sort of complete catalogue of diamonds?</p>

<p>I was going from <code>xena.B</code> to <code>xena.D</code> in my example, in the xena namespace, and getting a name which depended only on <code>D</code>. I guess I want to have B tagging along somehow. Is there some clever thing you can do with dots?</p>

<p>I think the term <code>type class diamond</code> is used whenever there are two ways to go from class <code>A</code> to class <code>D</code>, regardless of whether the two resulting instances are definitionally equal or not. I think it will be quite a big problem if you have a diamond and the resulting instances are not definitionally equal (whether they are provably equal is less important. I think we should restrict instances enough so that we don't get these kinds of bad diamonds.</p>

<p>I don't think Sebastian said the type class system won't change. He wrote they didn't know yet what would be a better system. It's clear it has to improve, the current system simply doesn't scale.</p>

<p>For example, B and C both extend A and D extends both B and C. If you have a D then you probably want the As to be defeq, but there's no way to even express that.</p>

<p>I think the issues are mostly the same in both. I guess I didn't pick the best example--in this case Lean will deduplicate the A fields in D if you use the old structure command, I think?</p>

<p>because you have lots of things that extend A, and you don't want to make all the combinations.<br>
Then you have no way to say "A which is both B and C"</p>

<p>Hi! Author of that post here.

<p>Yeah, the diamonds I saw mentioned in the backlog here are diamonds in the inference search tree, not in the algebraic hierarchy (which are the kinds of diamonds that bundling approaches have problems with). I mention that issue in my post as well though I dont call it a dimaond -- this is the exponential blowup coming from the <code>Monoid A -&gt; Semigroup A</code> instance together with the <code>prod</code> instances, where there are now two ways to derive <code>Monoid (A*A) -&gt; Semigroup (A*A)</code>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222132">@RalfJ</span> Lean has the same foundational problem, but it isn't yet a big issue. The blog post doesn't discuss the style used in mathlib, which is to have "partially unbundled" structures, where the type is a parameter but none of the operators. This minimizes the nesting level, although there are some examples where we have deeper depth like modules (that use two variables) and there was an example using three variables that floated on the chat recently</p>

<p>Also, not mentioned in that asymptotic analysis is the amount of subterm sharing in the term. I think the size of those instances is actually linear, but if you write it as a tree instead of a dag then it becomes quadratic or cubic etc</p>

<p>One of my main motivations for doing perfectoids was to see if Lean could handle them -- it was clear from the start that it was theoretically possible but Patrick pointed out very early on that this didn't mean that it was possible, and at times I was (incorrectly) worried that it might not be. I am still trying hard to understand what Mario wrote about timeouts. I've taken to trying to compile the perfectoid project with smaller values for the timeout parameter and am trying to understand what makes part of it slow to compile -- everything so far is pointing at naivity in the code -- poor proof engineering, as Mario calls it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"partially unbundled" structures, where the type is a parameter but none of the operators</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mentioned having the operators unbundled but the superclasses bundled, that gives you <code>O(n^3)</code> If you just have the type unbundled you get <code>O(n^2)</code>, but you have even more sharing problems and you cannot even use the typeclasses for the operators and their notation before having shown the axioms. We had some cases where that was annoying, but the real trouble here is sharing once your inheritance hierarchy has a diamond.</p>

<p>not mentioned in that asymptotic analysis is the amount of subterm sharing in the term. I think the size of those instances is actually linear, but if you write it as a tree instead of a dag then it becomes quadratic or cubic etc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I explicitly mention that in the conclusion. :) And yes, if you fully exploit sharing I think it remains linear. But then you have to ensure that every pass traversing your AST (unification, reduction, elaboration, type checking, whatever...) exploits sharing. A single lapse and your get the bad complexities back. At least in the Coq world people tell me that is not feasible.</p>

<p>I don't think so... you have to be dealing with some pretty complicated objects for it to come up, so if it was an issue it would have stopped us already</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in our case, it was really when we started to put the hierarchy to use that the performance became an issue. as long as you are just defining your algebraic classes and show all sorts of properties about them it's good, but then we ended up defining our logic with 5 or more nested combinators (i.e., the equivalent of <code>Zn 5</code>), and then we nest that <em>again</em> in several more layers, so we end up with n=10 and more -- and then we have quite a few lemmas about that, and everything got slow. I have no idea what people have been doing in Lean so I cannot compare.</p>

<p>I was referring to my post; I mean that we had something like <code>iProp := T*U*V -&gt; A -&gt; B</code>, where <code>*</code> and <code>-&gt;</code> have TC instances like <code>prod</code> in my post. This is like <code>Zn 5 = Z*Z*Z*Z*Z</code>.</p>

<p>and then we built things like <code>((X -&gt; iProp) -&gt; T -&gt; iProp) -&gt; ((X -&gt; iProp) -&gt; T -&gt; iProp)</code>. So if you count the number of combinators here, it's... 20 or more.</p>
