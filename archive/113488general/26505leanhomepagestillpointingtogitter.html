<p>I occasionally notice that <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/">Lean's web pages</a> still point to gitter, and we occasionally get questions there; perhaps the signage isn't good enough for everyone. How could we go about changing this? I could make a PR but someone will have to point me to the location of the git source for those pages (not least so I can check the PR is not already made).</p>

<p>I think we just run into the general problem that PRs here risk annoying Leo.</p>

<p>I know, but on this particular occasion I am personally prepared to take the risk. I have been extremely good at not annoying Leo recently -- a few months ago I was desperate to email him to tell him 100 things and Tom Hales just basically went "No. No. No. No. No. Leave him alone." This is a one-line PR to fix something which is broken and the review process is trivial.</p>

<p>But I've now found two links to Zulip in the Lean docs / GH pages, and one link to gitter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't. If someone could open a PR with some new wording (is it still a "public" "chat room"?), I'll talk to Leo</p>

<p>Good catch Patrick. As you all know I've been pushing for more users in the maths community recently, and it's good to get the docs right. I don't care that Lean 4 is coming and there might be some chaos -- mathematicians need a <em>lot</em> of training in general and the sooner they start the better. In fact in some sense now we have a stable Lean it's quite a good time for new users to appear.</p>
