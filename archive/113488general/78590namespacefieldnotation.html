<p>Before I disappeared for a month to handle a visiting-family exception, I was experimenting with using more “namespace field notation.” That is, instead of using <code>list.map f l</code>, I would use <code>l.map f</code>. I like the conciseness gained by removing the namespace <code>list</code>.</p>
<p>However, I had started to sour on it then, and, after returning to my code and trying to refresh my working cache, I find that I no longer like it. Since the field notation differs from the definition notation and from the pretty-printed <code>lean</code> output in errors, going back and forth between notations requires repeatedly reorienting on the positions of arguments. (While <code>list.map</code> is a nice example for advocating use of the notation, when a definition has more than 2 parameters or typically needs bracketed arguments, the notation does not help.)</p>
<p>If we could write definitions using namespace field notation and if the notation were used by <code>lean</code> to pretty-print, I believe the benefit would become clear. Otherwise, I don't think I'll be using it much.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>It doesn't really make sense to use projection notation in definitions, since it requires that the variable already be declared and have known type. You certainly won't get this before you've even stated the theorem name</p>

<p>Perhaps there could be some alternative <code>notation</code>-like operation to allow being explicit about the projection instead of using the built-in rule that now exists.</p>

<p>What kind of flexibility are you thinking? Also I don't relish the idea of adding thousands of annotations for what is essentially redundant information, and having to keep it up to date. The current projection algorithm is easy to learn and completely uniform</p>

<p>"it" is pp projection notation. The elaborator has less to go on with projection notation, so if it can't solve for the type of a variable immediately projections just halt the whole type inference process. I'm saying that this situation may occur with pp expressions, assuming you aren't using some <code>pp.all</code> type option</p>

<p>Declaring which parameter should be used for projection is the main one that comes to mind. I recall running into an issue where projection didn't work, but I think it would if I could explicitly declare how to do it. (I don't remember the exact issue, unfortunately.)</p>

<p>Yes, I could see how that could be a problem if pretty-printing involves inferring the projection notation. But, given the above idea of an explicit projection notation, it would not need to infer anything.</p>

<p>Projection was less powerful early in its history, because you could only project with the first explicit argument. That restriction has since been dropped, so make sure that isn't the issue you are thinking of</p>

<p>it would still need to infer stuff even with projection annotations, since <code>x.bar</code> could mean either <code>list.bar x</code> if <code>x : list a</code> or <code>multiset.bar x</code> if <code>x : multiset a</code>, or even <code>x.bar</code> if <code>x</code> is a namespace</p>

<p>so there's no back and forth unless I'm doing a lot of copy paste from pp anyway, which produces non-human output for several reasons, that's not the only thing I want to change in general</p>

<p>Here's a simple example:</p>

<p>2. No projection:</p>

<p>Here are some questions and thoughts prompted by the discussion above:</p>
<p>Why shouldn't I be able to tell Lean to pretty-print the projection notation as in 1? I can already tell it to use some other <code>notation</code> or <code>infix</code>. I don't see how the inference problem is different.</p>
<p>Once I am allowed to say I want definition <code>d</code> to be pretty-printed with projection notation, why shouldn't I be able to declare which parameter is the projection target? Consequently, the declaration to “use projection notation” becomes another <code>notation</code> or <code>infix</code> but specialized to projection.</p>

<p>Like I said, a pp problem. There's nothing wrong with this in principle, except this is a core lean issue so it's not going to happen until lean 4, and that only if Leo thinks of this himself</p>

<p>There isn't really any choice in what argument can be the projection argument, except in definitions which, say, take in more than one <code>list</code> parameter. If you think the second argument is a better projection target than the first, then I suggest you reorder the parameters</p>

<p>I disagree. You could expand projection to include things outside the namespace of the definition.</p>

<p>No, that doesn't really work with the way projections are resolved. It gets the type of the argument, and uses that as a namespace to look up projections. If you want a projection to work on a certain argument, make sure the namespace lines up</p>

<p>It obviously has to key on <em>something</em>, since otherwise it has to go through all the definitions, and the only available information at that point is the type of the variable</p>

<p>I don't see the difference between an explicit projection notation and naming the definition appropriately so the automatic method picks out the desired argument. Do you have a concrete example where you think it would be difficult to do otherwise?</p>

<p>Generally, though, suppose you have a definition that is not for general <code>list</code>s but has a <code>list</code> parameter and you want projection on an <code>list</code> argument, you would need to put the definition in the <code>list</code> namespace. Slightly more concretely, suppose you have something like <code>def n.d : list n → Prop</code>. So, to get projection notation, you would need to rename <code>n.d</code> to <code>list.d</code>. That seems wrong.</p>
