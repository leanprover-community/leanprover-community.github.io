<p>I've been asked to talk about Lean in our colloquium. Still freaking out... what should I put in such a talk? How do I manage expectations, so that they become realistic (instead of "Blah, unusable crap" or "They'll use AI to prove millenium problems. They're stealing our jobs.")</p>

<p>In some sense freshmen students will have a lot more patience and persistence then tenured staff. If it doesn't work out of the box, we've lost them for a couple of years again.</p>

<p>Still, the fact that I was asked to give a talk shows that there is some interest among them. And I want to capitalize on that.</p>

<p>If you want to attract mathematicians, I think the best you can do is to work on perfectoid spaces. Look at how we hooked people. If I understand correctly,  Bryan,  Soham and you came here because you heard about either schemes or perfectoid spaces in Lean. It would be interesting to compare with what happened in Coq. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110172">@Assia Mahboubi</span> how many mathematicians or advanced maths students showed up in Coq forums or mailing lists when the odd order theorem proof was announced?</p>

<p>If we manage to complete the definition, you'll be able to show nice dependency graphs displaying how much maths goes into this definition.</p>

<p>I wanted to concentrate on preparing my course in September but lots of things are happening. I just need to work harder. I don't think mid-October is an unreasonable target for perfectoid spaces. Sometimes when I look at the definition I think "this is easy, there's nothing left apart from a bunch of standard stuff which should be easy", and at other times I remember that I watched Mario take three hours to prove the math-trivial fact that the two standard definitions of Noetherian module are equivalent and then the realisation hits me. Another concern I have is that people are appearing out of the woodwork, either here or in my inbox, saying "can I help?" and currently I just seem to be saying "Sure! Just join in!". I meant to spend some time yesterday getting on top of the perfectoid project (like I did with the scheme project in Paris -- getting it to compile again!) but all I managed to do was remove some of the errors we get when compiling.</p>

<p>Most of my summer students have finished now though, so I will hopefully be far more active in Sept in the project than I have been in July and Aug (I've spent a <em>lot</em> of time talking to undergraduates about UG level maths in Lean recently).</p>

<p>I am being funded to run a Lean course which starts on Oct 1st, with 250 students, and out of the 100 formalised maths questions and solutions which I need to prepare to run this course, I have so far finished 1. On the other hand my kids go back to school on Wednesday and life gets a bit saner after that. I think what I currently need is a clearer view of the route to the finish line. Occasionally I look at the point in Wedhorn's paper that we're up to, and it's the line "let V_pre denote the category of topological spaces endowed with a presheaf of topological rings having some properties" and I always think "I wonder if Scott's library can help me here?". <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110524">@Scott Morrison</span> I can easily make this category "by hand" -- if I want perfectoid spaces done by mid-Oct should I do so?</p>

<p>I keep looking at the definition and thinking "he's taking a directed limit to construct the stalk -- I did all that by hand in the schemes repo, I wonder whether I should just sit and wait this time".

<p>It would be nice to write direct/filtered colimits in a way that makes it easy to see how to generalise. Reid was talking about eventually writing some machinery (possibly having to involve some tactics, I'm not sure) that would construct limits and filtered colimits just from knowing properties of the forgetful functor.</p>

<p>This is true; I write a good amount of Haskell and so I've been aware of, e.g. work in Coq/Agda/Idris (and Liquid Haskell) on proving data-structures or algorithms correct, or space/time-complexity bounds, and so on, but was never motivated to jump into that sort of thing. </p>

<p>As a further data point in the question of usability of proof assistants in real-life (well, mathematical real-life), you can have a look at <a href="http://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~gouezel/articles/morse_lemma.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~gouezel/articles/morse_lemma.pdf">http://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~gouezel/articles/morse_lemma.pdf</a> (preliminary version).</p>
<p>Some time ago, I mentioned that I found a gap in a published paper while formalizing it in Isabelle. This gap is now corrected, and the new proof is completely formalized. The above paper explains the corrected proof, for mathematicians, but it also mentions the formalized proof. By the way, it raises interesting questions on the way to write a math papers when you have a formalized proof (when we need a lemma that is related, but not exactly the same, to results already in the literature, should we give the proof or just point the reader to the formalized proof?) We have tried to find some middle ground here, but I guess our way to write papers will have to change. Comments welcome!</p>

<p>It seems pretty clear to me that "our way to write papers will have to change" when we have formalized proofs. Writing technical details in TeX is pointless of you have a formal proof. You should rather spend the energy on explaining what's going on</p>

<p>a  (λ,C)-quasi-geodesic is a (λ,C)-quasi-isometry defined on an interval. A geodesic is a (1,0)-quasi-geodesic, yes. All these terms are supposed to be standard in the domain. As for the explanations of Isabelle code, since the math statement is given just before the Isabelle statement, I was hoping that the correspondance would be easy to make for people interested in the formalization, but maybe I am too optimistic. If you have a hard time reading the statement, I should definitely add some details (or maybe this is because you are too used to Lean syntax...)</p>

<p><code>'a</code> is the Isabelle name for a type (in the same way that, in Lean, your <code>X</code> would be called alpha). <code>Q</code> is the quasi-geodesic and <code>f</code> is its parametrization. Thanks for the comments, I will try to make it more self-contained.</p>

<p>Of course I should switch to Lean, the future is there. But a rough estimate for me is that proving in Isabelle is probably 20 times faster than in Lean.<br>
Look at these lines:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  also have &quot;... = lambda^2 * (11/2 * C + (3200*exp(-459/50*ln 2)/ln 2 + 83) * delta)&quot;
    unfolding Kmult_def K_def L_def alpha_def D_def using ‹delta &gt; 0› ‹lambda ≥ 1› by (simp add: algebra_simps divide_simps power2_eq_square mult_exp_exp)
  also have &quot;... ≤ lambda^2 * (11/2 * C + 91 * delta)&quot;
    apply (intro mono_intros, simp add: divide_simps, approximation 14)
    using ‹delta &gt; 0› by auto
</pre></div>


<p>Is there an automatic way in Lean to prove that <code>3200*exp(-459/50*ln 2)/ln 2 + 83</code> is bounded by <code>91</code>?</p>

<p>Hm, I still miss some things from Isabelle, like most simp procs are just not available.  But this is something I'm sure we get with Lean 4 (or we implement it ourselves). A prover for simple logical statements like <code>auto</code> is missing. Type (class) inference in Isabelle is more predictable.<br>
But my general feeling  is that I'm now faster in Lean than in Isabelle. Lean also feels more responsive.</p>

<p>If you were allowed an import which did the boring bits behind the scenes, then I reckon irrationality of sqrt(2) would fit into 10 minutes, if you formalised it as the assertion that there were no positive nats a and b with a^2=2b^2, or something close to that. But why not go with infinitely many primes? Just hide the tedious work behind an import which you wrote earlier.</p>

<p>I just think that you should tell them that this is actual work in progress and this is what can be done now, and later on it will work in proper mathlib. Or actually just not bore them at all with technical details like this, if time is tight. Who is the actual audience? Does mathlib have something like translation invariance of Lebesgue measure on the reals? What do these people want to see? Existence of complicated things, or proofs of simple things?</p>

<p>No one directly complained about the types vs. sets things. I did talk to a quite a few people afterwards (drinks in the department, then drinks at the faculty bar...). From those discussions, I realised the thing I should have been clearer about was the distinction between automatic and interactive theorem proving.</p>

<p>On a side note, I would love to make a fake screen capture sometime, of an interaction with emacs, writing a proof in LaTeX, and occasionally hitting C-<span class="emoji emoji-1f528" title="hammer">:hammer:</span> and having emacs fill in a few sentences for you.</p>

<p>I gave another talk today, this time in the local "logic" seminar at ANU, which has quite a few participants who use/develop interactive theorem provers. (Notably Michael Norrish, who was involved, I think, in Sledgehammer.)</p>

<p>So Scott -- you just recorded yourself when you gave the Adelaide colloquium? I am giving a colloquium in Sheffield a week today and I conjecture that these are not recorded in general. You got louder and quieter as you moved nearer and further from your laptop but I was quite happy to live with this minor issue because the advantages of seeing your talk far outweighed it.</p>

<p>Patrick: who cares when modules are done. Perfectoids are not going to be done for a while yet, however all of us know that perfectoids <em>can</em> be done (which is the main claim) and will be done soon, although the actual path to nirvana involves Mario, Johannes, you, Johan, Me and Scott, <em>at least</em>, and we all have other things to do, so sometimes progress is slow.</p>

<p>I think I take a more pragmatic view. I'll talk about perfectoids in my talk on Wednesday but I don't expect anyone to be racing to download and install Lean and then immediately cloning our project to see how it all works. Any newcomers face a mountain before they can even understand the complex current status of the perfectoid project properly, and anyone who doesn't download Lean (i.e. 99% of my audience) can just know that it's "work in progress with light very much at the end of the tunnel".</p>

<p>My talk on Wed has changed quite a bit. I would say I learnt quite a lot in the last few weeks about what is going on here. Computer scientists and mathematicians have two different definitions of pure mathematics. They meet at the bottom with proofs that sqrt(2) is irrational etc, but after some point the sociological aspects of mathematics start influencing our tribe, and not theirs, and this makes some things quite different. Our experts proclaim what is proved and what is not proved; we try to choose the appropriate experts for each theorem, and our experts do not always get it right. However we have things that the CS world view does not have, like a very fluid understanding of techniques, and guiding principles such as the global Langlands reciprocity "principle", which is not even a well-defined statement but which seems to have well-defined consequences (for example functoriality, which can certainly be made into a formal statement (in more than one way, depending on how optimistic you want to be)). We also have very different opinions on what comprises beautiful mathematics. Both communities have a lot to offer each other in the future, I believe, and the main issue stopping this from happening is that there are very few experts in one area who know any more than epsilon about the modern tools available in the other area. That's what we have to change.</p>

<p>My talk is today. I'm going to say just that there are two different ways of doing pure mathematics and over the last year I have realised how little the two groups of people doing them are communicating with one another, and that both have a lot to offer the other side.</p>

<p>I don't think I'm going to make any claims about how using these tools is easy. In fact saying "I took a year of doing number theory research and learnt mathematics from scratch starting with undergraduate level, then graduate, then research" is not a particularly good advert for how easy they are. But this can be fixed. All we need is a good book.</p>

<p>It went fine. About 100 people (including <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130308">@Neil Strickland</span> ), but I spent most of my talk talking about the "mess" that mathematics was in, and just the last 15 minutes suggesting that mathematicians and computer scientists should talk more.

<p>I spent over half the talk giving what I thought was a fairly level-headed summary of things like the current status of the classification of finite simple groups and Arthur's work on the trace formula -- parts of maths where there are holes in the literature. I then talked a little bit about errors in the literature and also in the first half spent a bit of time philosophising about the nature of mathematics as done by humans and talking about various sociological issues which interfere with a formalist's viewpoint of what mathematics should be (I've been reading books by Bruno Latour). I then showed them Lean and some code that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> wrote, stressing that he had no computing experience when he arrived at Imperial 1 year ago (I did no live coding, for tedious technical reasons -- a minor system failure there) and showed off some of my summer students' work, and finished with a plea that mathematicians and computer scientists should work together more closely in the future on a common vision for pure mathematics, because we both have things to offer the other "tribe".</p>
<p>Neil Strickland was a very engaging host, he knows a lot about other proof assistants and I trusted him to provide a perhaps more unbiased view than that which I might find here (that's not an accusation -- I think people here are very level-headed in general, but many of us know more about Lean than any other system). But I definitely came away from that conversation feeling that I had not made a mistake in choosing Lean. Tom Bridgeland is another mathematician that I have a lot of respect for, and was very pleased he came to lunch with us; he also had interesting questions and comments. He pointed out that Carlos Simpson had formalised localising categories in Coq a decade ago, which I didn't know (I think of Simpson as a mathematician, and I know that most mathematicians wouldn't be able to formalise anything). In some sense the funniest thing Bridgeland said was that he didn't care less about the foundations of his subject, he just got on with it, which I thought was interesting for someone who used categories so much. I met the person who taught the introduction to proof course and told them to send me some of their problem sheets and I'd see what I could do with them.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> great talk, it's a real shame that audio gets a lot worse halfway through the talk. Loved the joke about old mathematicians dying out :D (you guys do get a lot of freedom in what you can say at work!). I think what could have been valuable (maybe you said it and I missed it) was that regardless of how the proof is written, it gets compiled down to a simplified form checked by a trusted kernel. Otherwise using the backwards reasoning tactic seems a bit like a cheat!</p>

<p>I emailed Mochizuki and he clarified a couple of things in response to some direct questions about his Report. I will continue to probe as I get time. For example: he discusses "gluing two [char 0] fields along their common subfield Q" in the Report. I imagined this to be some kind of formal colimit, or the pushout of rings or similar, and so asked what it really was: he said he meant the pushout of sets. I suspect there's a lot of these details that are in fact quite crucial to the category-theoretic constructions that are not very explicit.</p>

<p>I think it was ok. Of course I rushed at the end and live coding doesn't work so well when you are already 5 minutes over time. But I think people were happy. I'll know more today because I'll spend the day in the department. There should be a video recording available at some point (but the talk was in French)</p>

<p>Well, I have one small further insight: for Mochizuki, a diagram in a category is a <strong>subcategory</strong>, not a functor from a diagram shape. This probably stems from his desire to only ever use isomorphism classes of functors. I will write up a blog post when I can get all I sensibly can.</p>

<p>So I gave a school talk yesterday (to bright 17 year olds who had elected to go on a maths camp -- it's "half term" here so kids have a week off). It went better than my last school talk, it has probably got as far as "OK" but I am still not at "brilliant". One thing I have learnt is that even these bright schoolkids <em>do not know what induction is</em> which is a real problem when trying to do anything. However they <em>do</em> know what the complex numbers are! Here was what I did, and I think it went OK:</p>
<p>1) Observation that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1+2+3=6</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.72777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathrm">1</span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mord mathrm">2</span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mord mathrm">3</span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mord mathrm">6</span></span></span></span> but they did make a choice about which addition to do first, because with <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>9</mn><mo>−</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">9-2-1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.72777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mbin">−</span><span class="mord mathrm">2</span><span class="mbin">−</span><span class="mord mathrm">1</span></span></span></span> it really matters which subtraction you do first. [NB this part of the talk is irrelevant because of what happened later]</p>
<p>2) Observation that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a+b=b+a</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.77777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit">a</span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mord mathit">b</span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mord mathit">b</span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mord mathit">a</span></span></span></span> is intuitively obvious if we think about addition as "getting more stuff" or "moving further in one direction", but that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.999999999...&lt;1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68354em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathrm">0</span><span class="mord mathrm">.</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">.</span><span class="mord mathrm">.</span><span class="mord mathrm">.</span><span class="mrel">&lt;</span><span class="mord mathrm">1</span></span></span></span> is also kind of intuitively obvious, as is <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>9</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.999999999...=1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathrm">0</span><span class="mord mathrm">.</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">9</span><span class="mord mathrm">.</span><span class="mord mathrm">.</span><span class="mord mathrm">.</span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mord mathrm">1</span></span></span></span> (and we can't just argue about which one is right -- we need rules and definitions -- "pictures are not enough"). </p>
<p>3) </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">inductive</span> <span class="n">thing</span>
<span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">stop</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">thing</span>
<span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">tick</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">thing</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">think</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and a long time talking about what this meant, culminating in a general understanding that every <code>thing</code> looked like <code>tick (tick (tick ...(tick (stop)))...</code></p>
<p>4) <code>thing</code> -&gt; <code>nats</code>, <code>stop</code> -&gt; <code>zero</code>, <code>tick</code> -&gt; <code>succ</code> (there were giggles about the "suck" word, maybe there are better words). <code>one := succ zero</code>, <code>two := succ (succ zero)</code>, <code>two' := succ (one)</code></p>
<p>5) Proof that <code>two = two'</code> by <code>rfl</code></p>
<p>6) Definition of induction as "proof by knocking over the first domino and watching the rest fall over" (note: kids these days have never seen a domino).</p>
<p>7) Definition of addition on <code>nats</code> <em>and no attempt to prove anything like associativity</em> because I realised it would simply be too hard. [rendering (1) obsolete]. Basically I bailed on associativity. I think that internalising the "two rules for addition" (the equation lemmas) and then using them to prove what is quite a complex thing (it's a good few lines) is too hard for schoolkids.</p>
<p>8) Proof that <code>one + one = two</code> from the axioms. This <em>worked</em>. Students could attempt to unravel what <code>one + one = two</code> means and see that the proof was <code>rfl</code>.</p>
<p>9) Now questions. I tell them that we prove <code>a+b=b+a</code> next, and ask what happens after that. "Definition of multiplication" says one. Eventually I get them to come up with the following plan: define <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> on nat, define int (because someone says "define subtraction!" and I say "We can't! How do we do 2 - 3?"), define <code>+-*</code> on int, define rat (because we can't do division until we do), define <code>+-*/</code> on rat, define <code>real</code>, define <code>+-*/</code> on real. Then define <code>complex</code>.</p>
<p>10) Show them the definition of <code>complex</code> as a pair of reals, invent stupid notation <code>[x,y]</code> for complexes because I tell them <code>x+yi</code> is not allowed because we didn't define <code>+</code> or <code>i</code> yet, then challenge them to define addition and multiplication, challenge them to prove on paper that multiplication is commutative.</p>
<p>So essentially no induction at all, and I get to show them random bits of Lean, and I <em>think</em> that this is just about a level which works. Still needs work, but a much more positive experience than last time when I was telling people that induction on false was <code>false -&gt; P</code>.</p>

<p>I might just give up and call it <code>nextone</code> or something. Coq uses <code>S</code> I think, which is probably not good for a school talk either.</p>

<p>How about a CS flavour with "increment". I think thinking about definitions of functions as computer programs is easier than talking about axioms, particularly because the distinction between axioms and definitions made in Lean is not made everywhere else. I certainly didn't have a clear idea about what an axiom was a year ago.</p>

<p>I like <code>inc</code>! It's sort of obvious what it means, <code>inc (inc zero)</code> means increment zero twice.</p>

<p>Kevin, how much time did it take you? When I did my workshop on commutativity of addition, I didn't get any giggles on succ, but it could be because by the time we got there, it was already 2 hours (with a single short break), and I had to give up on interactivity and fall back from workshop-style to lecture-style. I was still getting quite a lot of questions, and they at least <em>saw</em> me do the proofs, but some were getting really tired towards the end.</p>

<p>As a further data point in the question of usability of proof assistants in real-life (well, mathematical real-life), you can have a look at <a href="http://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~gouezel/articles/morse_lemma.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~gouezel/articles/morse_lemma.pdf">http://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~gouezel/articles/morse_lemma.pdf</a> (preliminary version).</p>
<p>Some time ago, I mentioned that I found a gap in a published paper while formalizing it in Isabelle. This gap is now corrected, and the new proof is completely formalized. The above paper explains the corrected proof, for mathematicians, but it also mentions the formalized proof. By the way, it raises interesting questions on the way to write a math papers when you have a formalized proof (when we need a lemma that is related, but not exactly the same, to results already in the literature, should we give the proof or just point the reader to the formalized proof?) We have tried to find some middle ground here, but I guess our way to write papers will have to change. Comments welcome!</p>
