<p>In the definition of <code>g</code>, I am forced to mark it as noncomputable, but what does that mean? I thought proofs were programs. Is my definition of <code>g </code>not a program? My proof of g_property uses the axiom of choice according to <code>#print axioms</code> -- and yet it's computable anyway (in the sense that I was not asked to mark it as noncomputable). And I was not asked to mark my definition of <code>lem</code> as computable, but that's a definition which apparently uses the axiom of choice too. What is going on? It all still looks totally random to me but I think I might understand things enough to actually begin to see what this <code>noncomputable</code> thing which I'm randomly asked to put in front of definitions and possibly theorems (does that happen?) actually means, if someone tries to explain it to me...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lean’s standard library defines an additional axiom, propositional extensionality, and a quotient construction which in turn implies the principle of function extensionality. These extensions are used, for example, to develop theories of sets and finite sets. We will see below that using these theorems can block evaluation in Lean’s kernel, so that closed terms of type ℕ no longer evaluate to numerals. But Lean erases types and propositional information when compiling definitions to bytecode for its virtual machine evaluator, and since these axioms only add new propositions, they are compatible with that computational interpretation. Even computationally inclined users may wish to use the classical law of the excluded middle to reason about computation. This also blocks evaluation in the kernel, but it is compatible with compilation to bytecode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from TPIL and it's one of very few parts of the book which I still do not understand. But I don't understand this paragraph at all. I don't know what bytecode is or the virtual machine. I need to be told something easier first.</p>

<p>What I do understand is that there are conjectures I know such as Waring's problem, where there is a number which I regard as "well-defined", but for which no mathematician knows an algorithm for working them out. I can see that these aren't "computable". I guess I don't see why the other things are computable.</p>

<p>It's okay to use choice to make a <code>Sort u</code>, or a proof. If you use it for anything else it's noncomputable.</p>

<p>I think the rules are simply<br>
1. Types and propositions and proofs are always computable (because they are not actually represented at all at runtime). That is, anything whose type is <code>Sort u</code> for some <code>u</code>. This also extends to Pi-types ending in <code>Sort u</code>.<br>
2. Axioms are not computable (because they have no definition). Normally I think this only applies to <code>choice</code> because the other standard axioms are propositions.<br>
3. Anything that uses something noncomputable is noncomputable, except that rule 1 always takes priority.</p>

<p>Maybe I've confused myself and rule 1 is really two separate rules (type erasure and proof irrelevance), not sure.</p>

<p>Ok so perhaps some examples of things which I might want to define are noncomputable <code>nat</code>s and noncomputable functions <code>f : X -&gt; Y</code>. So then my next, and I think my last, question is: what am I losing by having these things marked as noncomputable? Is the only difference that I am basically guaranteed not to be able to prove anything about these noncomputable gadgets using <code>rfl</code>? Is that it? I can just reason about these objects perfectly well using exactly the same sort of reasoning I would use in a maths paper. I would never want to use <code>rfl</code> on these objects anyway because I know they've been defined using some choice function.</p>
<p>With things like the perfectoid project I would work constructively by default, and would just write <code>noncomputable</code> in front of a definition every time Lean told me to. I could instead have just written <code>noncomputable theory</code> at the top of every file. What would I have lost if I'd done that? I am struggling to find any reason at all why I would ever care about computability. Let's say my goal was to define a perfectoid space and then state Scholze's tilting correspondence (this is feasible but would take a fair bit more work), and then let's say my next goal was to prove it (this would take an unfeasibly large amount of work unless I had a big team). Would I ever care about computability ever?</p>

<p><code>noncomputable theory</code> has no downsides except that it makes computability less obvious (which itself may not be a downside depending on your POV). It actually means "please infer <code>noncomputable</code> for me"</p>

<p>As I'm sure you've noticed, lean knows perfectly well which definitions are computable and which aren't, and without <code>noncomputable theory</code> it nags you until you put the markings it knows you should put. <code>noncomputable theory</code>just says to do this automatically without user interaction</p>

<p>Yes. It's the program that returns (x,y), when x is the witness to X being nonempty, and y is the witness to Y being nonempty.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the initial interpretation of "proof = program" was that a proof was supposed to be interpreted as some sort of proof using only constructive logic or intuitionistic logic or whatever. As we all know, this is not what is going on maths departments across the world -- they have a more powerful notion of proof. Does this just <em>break</em> Curry-Howard, or is there a rigorous but wider interpretation of "program" which I can use which fixes it?</p>

<p>macros: I did this in my thesis, which was written in plain TeX (which has no theorem numbering macros); I wrote the macros myself. I think my confusion is now resolved. I don't want to lose track of Chris' question above about computable <code>em</code>, I know he's been thinking a lot about univalence recently. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> do you know anything about </p>

<p>What I don't quite get is if I have computable choice and computable univalence, shouldn't I be able to get computable em. Obviously I can't, but I don't see where the proof breaks down.</p>

<p>univalence is not a nonconstructive principle, meaning that we have long believed that it has a constructive interpretation, but as defined in book HoTT it's an axiom, meaning that when you have to "call" it like a function you don't know what to do</p>

<p>I have this uncomfortable feeling about this (univalence axiom). When I was moaning about having built a bunch of structure on a ring R and then wanting to move it onto an isomorphic ring S,  people were saying "use HoTT". Now I wonder whether some of the terms I'd get out of this HoTT strategy would just be useless in practice because they have been created using an axiom. On the other hand I guess I make terms using the axiom of choice and seem to get away with it.</p>

<p>So this discussion has revealed the fact that I don't really know what a "program" is. I want to define a program as a "computer file" (a lean file, an olean file, a range of memory addresses) which can be turned by a compiler into something which can be run by my CPU. Is that a reasonable definition? Is that Curry-Howard's definition?</p>
<p>I am also a bit confused about definitions. Are definitions also sometimes programs?</p>
<p>Here are two theorems and two definitions.</p>

<p>Which of those things can be turned into "programs" in the sense of Curry and Howard?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So this discussion has revealed the fact that I don't really know what a "program" is. I want to define a program as a "computer file" (a lean file, an olean file, a range of memory addresses) which can be turned by a compiler into something which can be run by my CPU. Is that a reasonable definition? Is that Curry-Howard's definition?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that's a reasonable definition. The church turing thesis says that basically any reasonable definition of "program" lands on the exact same class of functions, which are the computable functions. A more traditional definition would use turing machines or reduction of lambda terms</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am also a bit confused about definitions. Are definitions also sometimes programs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you write <code>def</code> in lean, it goes through that compiling bit and produces something that can be run by the CPU, i.e. a program</p>

<p>I am also a bit confused about definitions. Are definitions also sometimes programs?</p>

<p>When you write <code>def</code> in lean, it goes through that compiling bit and produces something that can be run by the CPU, i.e. a program</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So D1 and T1 (the definition and theorem which worked in vanilla Lean with no classical or anything) are turned into programs by the Lean executable, and D2 is probably not (because it's not computable), and I'm still a bit confused about T2.</p>

<p>So the bytecode made with <code>D1</code> is a program. And there's no bytecode made for <code>T1</code> but if we weren't so proof-impredicative then there could be a program made for <code>T1</code>. And there's no program for <code>D2</code>, and there's no program for <code>T2</code> but that's for two reasons -- firstly because the VM forgets all proofs, and secondly because even if it didn't, it wouldn't be able to make the program because there's no program for <code>D2</code>.

<p>It works like a stack machine. Here's what the stack looks like, pushing items from the right:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>   []
0: [#0]
1: [#0, #1]
2: [#0, #1, #0]
3: [#0, #1, #0, #0]
4: [#0, #1, #1 #0 #0]
5: [#0, #1 #1 (#1 #0 #0)]
6: [#1 #0 (#1 #1 (#1 #0 #0))]

<p>the final line returns the value on the stack, which is <code>#1 #0 (#1 #1 (#1 #0 #0))</code></p>

<p>if you squint, you can read <code>#0</code> and <code>#1</code> as the constructors of both list and A, and see <code>cons a (cons b (cons a nil))</code></p>

<p>the idea is that you can read an olean file and it will be just as good as reading the lean file but without having to run all the tactics</p>

<p>Wikipedia says that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-mu_calculus" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-mu_calculus">Lambda-mu</a> calculus has classical proofs as programs, where AoC and double-negation elimination map to continuations</p>

<p>right, that's the "a bit weird" part I mentioned. Double negation elimination has a computational implementation</p>

<p>I know continuations are useful for implementing control flow / concurrency, so I suppose if a constructive proof describes an algorithm, then a classical proof is one that contains a step that says "yes, let me get back to you on that", in which case you could think of <code>sorry</code> as a type of continuation</p>

<p>I like to think of call/cc for LEM via oracles and time travel. You ask the oracle "Is RH true?" and it says NO, and gives you a token that says RH -&gt; false. You celebrate the resolution of the long standing problem, until one day when someone finds that RH is actually true. But when you confront the oracle with your proof of falsity, it takes your proof of RH, destroys the universe and rewinds to the original question, and when asked "Is RH true?" it says YES and gives you a bloodstained proof of RH, and you celebrate the resolution of the long standing problem.</p>
