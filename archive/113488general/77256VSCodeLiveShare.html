<p>I think I was just made aware of the extension Live Share in VSCode which allows collaboration</p>

<p>now we can have remote Lean hackathons!</p>

<p>Unfortunately it doesn't actually work. The remote person just gets random squiggles, because Lean is not actually running on their end.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is possible to modify the VS Code extension so that the output from the Lean server on the host's computer is actually propagated back to the client's.</p>

<p>(Similar with the LaTeX plugin. The client can't compile or even view the latest PDF from the host's end.)</p>

<p>It works better if you disable your own checking (i.e. on the bottom navigational bar (coloured blue by default) click <code>(checking visible files)</code> and select <code>nothing</code>), since the host's Lean is still fully functional and you can see the error transmitted from the host; however sometimes the errors go out of sync and it seems that the only way to resolve this issue is to quit and rejoin the session.</p>
