How would people feel about a 1-symbol version of `by assumption`? I now often have hypotheses with unenlightening names `H1` ... `H5`, and these labels are all over the place in my proofs. But they don't really convey any information. I could use the french quotes to tell Lean the type, and it will start looking for a fitting assumption. But often I find that pretty verbose. Because usually, it's just an annoying proof obligation that we want to get rid of. How about `!`, or maybe the unicode `…`?

I can see you are tempted by the SSReflect cabalistic road...

I think this is part of what SSReflect `//` does

 I know of a guild that doesn't write anything when it comes to these proof obligations... it's completely transparent to them.

Great, let's have a transparent unicode character! Let's take the one we use in real world math papers.

I am not a huge fan of this being a mathlib standard. Maybe in your personal code, you can make your own `meta def`, and then when you PR, you can search and replace?

Or a VSCode tab-completion when you start writing `by a`

If `H3` is uninformative, wouldn't `!` be even more uninformative?

At least with `H3` the IDE will tell you the type

After a bit more thought, maybe the most most user-friendly version (both for reading and writing) would be to have a VScode keyboard shortcut that looks at the type of the current `_` and replaces it with `\f< the_type \f>`. It really is a pity that we can't invoke hole commands on bare `_`. Otherwise a hole command would be perfect.

a simple available compromise is `\f<_\f>`

I would also be happy if `\f<\f>` worked but I think that requires a bit more parsing magic

I would agree with this. I imagine the VSCode extension could just replace the `_` with a `{! _ !}` and then invoke the hole command--we shouldn't be limited by Lean here.

I would prefer it just replace the hole with a reference to the actual hypothesis

Why not the `\f< the_type \f>` version? It is less "Lean-explicit" but it is a whole lot more "math-explicit".
