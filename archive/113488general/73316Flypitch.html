<p>Hi everyone! I'm pleased to announce that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span> and I have completed a formalization of forcing and the unprovability of the continuum hypothesis.</p>
<p>Our source code is <a href="https://github.com/flypitch/flypitch" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/flypitch/flypitch">located here</a>. There is some cleaning up to do, but there is a file <code>summary.lean</code> with all the main results and definitions.</p>
<p>We also submitted a <a href="https://github.com/flypitch/flypitch-itp-2019/releases" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/flypitch/flypitch-itp-2019/releases">paper</a> describing this result to ITP 2019, and welcome your comments!</p>
