<p>Any recommendations for where to go after finishing the Natural Numbers Game? I suppose there's the Real Numbers Game (<a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/real-number-game" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/real-number-game">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/real-number-game</a>) which would be good since I don't have any experience using Lean with the real numbers. Might be able to dig up some of my old undergrad problem sets from calculus and formalize those. I think my large-scale goal is to start formalizing results in quantum information processing.</p>

<p>P.S. I'd also like to say the NNG turned out to be my favorite puzzle game of the past few years, despite the lack of fancy graphics or non-mathematical narrative motivation! Absolutely incredible, truly.</p>

<p>rofl, that's really crazy. Thanks. Did you know that all of maths is a game like the natural number game? Lean has turned out to be my favourite puzzle game of the past few years. These other games like the real number game, the group theory game, the logic game (basic propositions, stuff like (P and Q) or (P and R) = P and (Q or R)), the integer game, ...) are all in half-written states because I'm currently teaching and dealing with admissions for a big PhD programme. Note that there is also plenty of potential for the natural number game 2, proving that every positive integer is uniquely a product of primes and so on. Even just stuff about odd and even numbers is quite fun. </p>
<p>If you want to play the perfectoid space game, then <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-perfectoid-spaces/issues/33" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-perfectoid-spaces/issues/33">here are about 30 levels</a>. But the maths involved is much more serious. It's just another thing on my pile of stuff to do (this is my area of research).</p>
<p>There are some <a href="https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/blob/master/Maths_Challenges/challenges.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/blob/master/Maths_Challenges/challenges.md">maths challenges</a> here, which are short and sweet.</p>
<p>Here are the example sheets from a short (8 hour) course I taught last term to 1st year maths undergrads: <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/M40001_lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/M40001_lean">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/M40001_lean</a></p>
<p>It seems to me that there is loads of potential but we just have to find the time to do it. There is someone coming to Imperial for a 4 month "industrial placement"(!) who will work on some more games.</p>

<p>I still put an archive for Kevin at <a href="https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/math114.tar.bz2" target="_blank" title="https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/math114.tar.bz2">https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/math114.tar.bz2</a>. These are all the Lean files I used in my 2020 lectures so far. Everything you need to look at is in <code>src</code>. The file numbered 0 does not contain any exercise, it was shown on day one to give an idea of what Lean looks like, proving an early real analysis lemma (remember students had one semester of real analysis before my classes). Every other file contains a mixture of explanations, worked out examples and exercises. The lectures notes (with more details than what I actually discuss in class are at <a href="https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/enseignement/math114" target="_blank" title="https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/enseignement/math114">https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~pmassot/enseignement/math114</a>. The file called <code>dm.lean</code> is something I asked them to do at home between files 03 and 04 (5 Lean exercises, including two they had to also write on paper). The file <code>anatole1.lean</code> is a special file I used last Friday on my student who did each of the other files in at most 15 minutes (it is not something I will cover with the other students).</p>

<p>One can define addition and multiplication on <code>nat</code> in a completely different way, by first of all setting up a theory of cardinality of finite sets, and then defining addition to be "cardinality of disjoint union" and multiplication to be "cardinality of product". Then one really can give non-inductive proofs of things like <code>mul_comm</code> and <code>mul_assoc</code> of this form</p>

<p>I’m curious about one design decision in the natural numbers game, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>. In the real world, we would carefully add @[simp] to each lemma as we go. I notice you don’t do this - in multiplication world all the lemmas about addition are available to simp, but for example in <code>add_mul</code>, simp can’t do <code>mul_zero</code>.</p>

<p>But on the other hand we need to show newcomers that proving in Lean is not _as_ tedious as it first appears, because the automation gets better and better as you go along.</p>

<p>Doesn't it work eventually -- I think I can show a+b+c+d+e=e+d+c+b+a by simp at the end of it. I think you're suggesting we should start earlier.</p>

<p>(And indeed, the very idea that it’s important that the mathematician themselves improves the automation as they go along —- even if just by marking lemmas with @[simp] — May be worth getting across to new users.)</p>

<p>Oh dear. “Lean is busy” got stuck in the NNG, and so eventually I suggested to Simon that he reloads the page. That worked, but he’s really sad that all his proofs in earlier levels got lost. :-(</p>

<p>Regarding the <code>simp</code> discussion: it's not clear to me that this game is meant to teach Lean properly. I understand it as one possible fun introduction, but we don't expect people to start writing serious Lean code right after completing the game.</p>

<p>How does <code>simp</code> work exactly? Does lean do some kind of breadth-first search applying all theorems tagged with <code>[simp]</code> to the goal, trying to maximize a similarity score?</p>

<p>No. <code>simp</code> traverses the expression, starting at the deepest parts of the expression, and tries to transform subexpressions using the simp lemmas.</p>

<p>It is entirely undirected --- if a simp lemma can fire, it will.</p>

<p>(The <code>rewrite_search</code> tactic, that Keeley and I wrote a while back back haven't ported to mathlib, does do edit distance based scoring of rewrites.)</p>
