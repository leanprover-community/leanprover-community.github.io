<p><strong><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/Grants/Alexandria/" target="_blank" title="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/Grants/Alexandria/">ALEXANDRIA: Large-Scale Formal Proof for the Working Mathematician</a></strong></p>
<p><em>L. C. Paulson, Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematical proofs have always been prone to error. Today, proofs can be hundreds of pages long and combine results from many specialisms, making them almost impossible to check. One solution is to deploy modern verification technology. Interactive theorem provers have demonstrated their potential as vehicles for formalising mathematics through achievements such as the verification of the Kepler Conjecture. Proofs done using such tools reach a high standard of correctness.</p>
<p>However, existing theorem provers are unsuitable for mathematics. Their formal proofs are unreadable. They struggle to do simple tasks, such as evaluating limits. They lack much basic mathematics, and the material they do have is difficult to locate and apply.</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA will create a proof development environment attractive to working mathematicians, utilising the best technology available across computer science. Its focus will be the management and use of large-scale mathematical knowledge, both theorems and algorithms. The project will employ mathematicians to investigate the formalisation of mathematics in practice. Our already substantial formalised libraries will serve as the starting point. They will be extended and annotated to support sophisticated searches. Techniques will be borrowed from machine learning, information retrieval and natural language processing. Algorithms will be treated similarly: ALEXANDRIA will help users find and invoke the proof methods and algorithms appropriate for the task.</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA will provide (1) comprehensive formal mathematical libraries; (2) search within libraries, and the mining of libraries for proof patterns; (3) automated support for the construction of large formal proofs; (4) sound and practical computer algebra tools.</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA will be based on legible structured proofs. Formal proofs should be not mere code, but a machine-checkable form of communication between mathematicians.</p>
<p>The project will run for 60 months starting 1 September 2017.</p>

<p>Yeah exactly. So I emailed him saying "you're just up the road from me, how come you're not reaching out to mathematicians like me so we can talk about this sort of stuff?" and he said "yeah I'm just sitting in my office like usual really" so I said "OK so you can reach out to me by me coming to visit on Tuesday and you telling me what it's all about" and he said "OK"</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding maybe a bit unimpressed, but I think that this proposal is not overly ambitious.  It's basically a continuation of current work in Isabelle.  The goals are pretty much 1) formalize some undergrad math, 2) improve the search function a bit, 3) add more refactoring tools, and 4) integrate and polish some computer algebra tactics.</p>

<p>Thanks for this Gabriel. In mathematics it seems to be extremely difficult to get these big ERC grants, in the sense that the people I know who have got them recently have put in some very high-powered proposals.</p>

<p>I sometimes write "low-level" proofs, and I find them very enjoyable (my instincts just tell me to press on instead of trying tactics), but I do feel at the end of it all that they are no more readable than any other Lean code, they are just intro, apply, intro, refine, intro, exact, cases, cases, rwa, done</p>

<p>In France attending a conference in mid-August pretty much automatically implies divorce</p>

<p>Huh, so August in the Netherlands is not quite as bad as it sounds like <a href="https://www.frenchtoday.com/blog/french-vocabulary/french-vacation-vocabulary-expressions-les-vacances" target="_blank" title="https://www.frenchtoday.com/blog/french-vocabulary/french-vacation-vocabulary-expressions-les-vacances">August in France</a> is, but I was always surprised how quiet it got.</p>

<p>You mean the conference in August? I already had to negotiate with my wife to go to ICM, another conference this summer is completely impossible. So no, I have not discussed it with Assia.</p>

Dagsthul is the CS's Oberwolfach so it is invitation only and  the application (including the list of invitees) has been crafted a long time ago.
