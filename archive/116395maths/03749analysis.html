<p>Hi there, I was wondering if we had a proof formalised in Lean yet that the limit of (sin(x))/x is equal to 1. I looked over Mathlib and couldn't find anything of the sort.</p>

<p>I don't think we have. We have very little "concrete" results so far.</p>

<p>I also think it might be quite a challenge given current technology. But you might be able to reuse a whole bunch of computations that Chris used for the definition of pi</p>

<p>This is basically equivalent to proving that the derivative of sin is cos, which in my mind is a key missing thing. What I think we really need is that a power series is differentiable within its radius of convergence.</p>

<p>At school I was told that we would at some point prove that sin(x)/x tended to 1 as x tended to zero. We then used that fact to deduce that the derivative of sin was cos, and then later on after we'd drawn the graph of sin and had got thoroughly used to the fact that its derivative at 0 was cos(0)=1, the teacher told us that it was now obvious that sin(x)/x tended to 1 because cos(0)=1.</p>

<p>I guess the road map is to</p>
<ol>
<li>Define power series, with ROC, etc</li>
<li>Define sine as some power series, prove that that power series converges (possibly before defining sine to be that power series) </li>
<li>Do a similar thing for cosine</li>
<li>Use the Fréchet derivative in mathlib to ge the univariate derivative.</li>
<li>Prove some result like what Chris has mentioned about being able to differentiate inside the power series within the ROC or something else about uniform convergence</li>
<li>Differentiate the sine power series, see that it is equal to the cosine power series</li>
<li>Try to generalise to the complex numbers (shouldn't be too difficult, just replace a bunch of symbols and then fix things)</li>
<li>Try to generalise even further to some sufficiently regular algebraic structure</li>

<p>Yes please do this. If people want to change it later that's fine. I am interested in formalising parts of our undergraduate syllabus and the fact that the derivative of sin is cos is used from day 1 in the "methods" courses (without justification, because everyone was told it in high school and the methods courses continue with this tradition) so this sort of thing is a big roadblock to even beginning to formalise the problem sheets in these courses.</p>

<p>I would suggest focusing on <code>exp</code> for this roadmap. <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> should follow as algebraic combinations, not more power series</p>

<p>I've also said this before, but the theory of power series and termwise differentiation is not required for <code>exp</code>; you can take the derivative at zero by some elementary estimates, using the definition of the derivative</p>

<p>Ah, yes this makes sense. I see that in <code>data/complex/exponential.lean</code> we have that <code>exp</code> is defined as a power series and <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> are algebraic combinations of <code>exp</code> as you suggest.</p>

<p>Right, of course - I can just guess the derivative of exp and then show it satisfies the definition of a Fréchet derivative. And I can also do the same with sin! Sorry, I was still in the "analysis 2" mindset where you don't know any multivariate calculus yet; at my university we proved all these derivative theorems by differentiating a power series term by term.</p>

<p>The trick with <code>exp</code> is to prove that <code>exp' 0 = 1</code>, and then <code>exp' a = (exp (a+x))' (x=0) = (exp a * exp x)' (0) = exp a * exp' 0 = exp a</code></p>

<p>in other words, you can exploit <code>exp (a+x) = exp a * exp x</code> and the multiplication rule for differentiation to reduce the problem to calculating the derivative at zero</p>

<p>Of course. But I like to have the developments follow the needs, when possible, and use the simplest tool for the job. In metamath I used a basic tail estimate to find the derivative of exp, and it wasn't until the lagrange formula for pi that I needed the actual theory of power series, to prove that Abel's theorem applies to the power series for the arctangent.</p>

<p>'The job' involves a bunch of things that aren't going to be Riemann integrable</p>

<p>It's possible that some of the power series work can be reused for the proof that exp is differentiable, but I think it is unlikely</p>

<p>the direct elementary proof is pretty simple, it's hard to beat</p>

<p>in order to apply the general theory you still need to know a bunch of things about the ROC that amount to the same tail estimates I'm talking about</p>

<p>To reiterate, I think that the general theory of power series is useful and we should put it on the todo list. But it's not blocking elementary calculus</p>

<p>I just wanted to mention that the question whether <code>deriv ℝ sin = cos</code> makes sense in mathlib since 20 minutes (i.e., the moment <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1670" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1670">#1670</a> was merged).

<p>What are good resources for learning about filters? Are filters "common knowledge" or are they a weird quirk? That is, if I ask one of my analysis professors about filters will they start talking about coffee or analysis?</p>

<p>Filters are treated in Bourbaki. You can also read about them in any treatment on the Stone-Cech compactification, or compactness in model theory.</p>

<p>Besides the wikipedia page, you can also look at Johannes's paper on filters for formalization of analysis: <a href="http://home.in.tum.de/~hoelzl/documents/hoelzl2013typeclasses.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://home.in.tum.de/~hoelzl/documents/hoelzl2013typeclasses.pdf">http://home.in.tum.de/~hoelzl/documents/hoelzl2013typeclasses.pdf</a></p>
