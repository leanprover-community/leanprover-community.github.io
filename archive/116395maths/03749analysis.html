<p>Hi there, I was wondering if we had a proof formalised in Lean yet that the limit of (sin(x))/x is equal to 1. I looked over Mathlib and couldn't find anything of the sort.</p>

<p>I don't think we have. We have very little "concrete" results so far.</p>

<p>I also think it might be quite a challenge given current technology. But you might be able to reuse a whole bunch of computations that Chris used for the definition of pi</p>

<p>This is basically equivalent to proving that the derivative of sin is cos, which in my mind is a key missing thing. What I think we really need is that a power series is differentiable within its radius of convergence.</p>

<p>At school I was told that we would at some point prove that sin(x)/x tended to 1 as x tended to zero. We then used that fact to deduce that the derivative of sin was cos, and then later on after we'd drawn the graph of sin and had got thoroughly used to the fact that its derivative at 0 was cos(0)=1, the teacher told us that it was now obvious that sin(x)/x tended to 1 because cos(0)=1.</p>

<p>I guess the road map is to</p>
<ol>
<li>Define power series, with ROC, etc</li>
<li>Define sine as some power series, prove that that power series converges (possibly before defining sine to be that power series) </li>
<li>Do a similar thing for cosine</li>
<li>Use the Fréchet derivative in mathlib to ge the univariate derivative.</li>
<li>Prove some result like what Chris has mentioned about being able to differentiate inside the power series within the ROC or something else about uniform convergence</li>
<li>Differentiate the sine power series, see that it is equal to the cosine power series</li>
<li>Try to generalise to the complex numbers (shouldn't be too difficult, just replace a bunch of symbols and then fix things)</li>
<li>Try to generalise even further to some sufficiently regular algebraic structure</li>

<p>Yes please do this. If people want to change it later that's fine. I am interested in formalising parts of our undergraduate syllabus and the fact that the derivative of sin is cos is used from day 1 in the "methods" courses (without justification, because everyone was told it in high school and the methods courses continue with this tradition) so this sort of thing is a big roadblock to even beginning to formalise the problem sheets in these courses.</p>

<p>I would suggest focusing on <code>exp</code> for this roadmap. <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> should follow as algebraic combinations, not more power series</p>

<p>I've also said this before, but the theory of power series and termwise differentiation is not required for <code>exp</code>; you can take the derivative at zero by some elementary estimates, using the definition of the derivative</p>

<p>Ah, yes this makes sense. I see that in <code>data/complex/exponential.lean</code> we have that <code>exp</code> is defined as a power series and <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> are algebraic combinations of <code>exp</code> as you suggest.</p>

<p>Right, of course - I can just guess the derivative of exp and then show it satisfies the definition of a Fréchet derivative. And I can also do the same with sin! Sorry, I was still in the "analysis 2" mindset where you don't know any multivariate calculus yet; at my university we proved all these derivative theorems by differentiating a power series term by term.</p>

<p>The trick with <code>exp</code> is to prove that <code>exp' 0 = 1</code>, and then <code>exp' a = (exp (a+x))' (x=0) = (exp a * exp x)' (0) = exp a * exp' 0 = exp a</code></p>

<p>in other words, you can exploit <code>exp (a+x) = exp a * exp x</code> and the multiplication rule for differentiation to reduce the problem to calculating the derivative at zero</p>

<p>Of course. But I like to have the developments follow the needs, when possible, and use the simplest tool for the job. In metamath I used a basic tail estimate to find the derivative of exp, and it wasn't until the lagrange formula for pi that I needed the actual theory of power series, to prove that Abel's theorem applies to the power series for the arctangent.</p>

<p>Given the spirit of mathlib, power series are probably going to end up being done with as much generality as possible. I don't know whether this includes noncommutative settings.</p>
<p>Currently, however, I personally am still at a fairly early stage; I've yet to fully understand the definition of the derivative because it's so general and it's written in lean.</p>

<p>Ok, then git clone is a good first move. Then you need to checkout the <code>lean-3.4.2</code> branch and call <code>cache-olean --fetch</code> (assuming your installed the supporting tooling as described in mathlib install page).</p>

<p>I've seen students just click on Lean files and open them with VS Code. I would say that pointing people towards cloning Patrick's test repo and using update-mathlib was a better idea than getting them to clone mathlib directly and then have to switch branches before cache-olean works. I think cloning the test repo is the easiest way to get going. See <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1728" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1728">#1728</a> (ooh, modular form number!)</p>

<p>Just to mention that this fact is proved in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1695" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/1695">#1695</a>, which is currently PRed to mathlib, so no need to work too hard on it. As for your question, you want to show that some set is a neighborhood of <code>y</code>. In maths terms, you need to find some <code>epsilon</code> such that your set contains the open interval <code>(y - epsilon, y + epsilon)</code>, so a math proof would certainly not start with <code>Let x ∈ ℝ such that ∥sin x + (-sin y + -((x + -y) * cos y))∥ ≤ c * ∥x + -y∥</code>. It would start with <code>let epsilon = c/10</code> (or whatever you need). Let me show that, for any <code>x</code> satisfying <code>|x - y| &lt; epsilon</code>, then  <code>∥sin x + (-sin y + -((x + -y) * cos y))∥ ≤ c * ∥x + -y∥</code>. The mathlib proof would definitely go this way, using additionally things like <code>filter.mem_sets_of_superset</code> and <code>mem_nhds_sets</code> (that say that a set containing a neighborhood of <code>y</code> is itself a neighborhood of <code>y</code>, and that an open set containing <code>y</code> is a neighborhood of <code>y</code>).</p>

<p>Note how your non-terminal <code>simp</code> with unwanted "simplification" (using the dreaded <code>sub_eq_add_neg</code>) is replaced by something much more controled. The last two lines are controversial, you may be better off with general notions than trying to get down to earth with absolute value, but they illustrate the power of <code>change</code>.</p>
