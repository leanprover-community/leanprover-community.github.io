<p>Currently we have a hack at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L178-L180" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L178-L180">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/maps.lean#L178-L180</a> ensuring that we could potentially extend by contuity some functions with values in a space which is not regular. Is there any use to this? The trade-off is we need to assume the dense embedding of the original space into the space we want to extend to is injective. I don't know any case where we want to target to be non-regular whereas there is a clear use case for dropping the injectivity assumption: the completion of uniform spaces.</p>

<p>Looking at the history of this "feature", I see <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes HÃ¶lzl</span> made me change that last summer, so it's probably safe to assume nothing will be impacted.</p>
