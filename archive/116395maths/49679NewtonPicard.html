<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="210574">@Patrick Massot</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130980">@Jan-David Salchow</span> I moved this from the <em>out_param again</em> thread. Newton-Picard looks great! It would be nice to have it in mathlib.</p>
<p>I agree with Patrick that before moving it to mathlib, we should think about whether the basic notions look the way we want them to. For example, <code>pos_real</code> belongs in <code>real</code> with <code>nnreal</code> and <code>ennreal</code>, and should probably be named <code>preal</code>, to match <code>pnat</code>(in the <code>data</code> folder). For another thing, I wonder whether it will later cause problems to have <code>moreover</code> be a token.</p>
<p>I don't have any recommendation as to how to use <code>deriv</code> as a function or partial function. I tend to be conservative and wait until I have an application before adding something to the library. So, for example, my tendency would be to keep using <code>has_fderiv</code> and <code>has_deriv</code> until there is a good reason not to (for example, because they don't work well with calculations). And then that application will help us figure out what we want.</p>
<p>I do have some ideas as to how to make calculations with partial functions more palatable, and I am hoping to experiment with that soon. </p>
<p>Jan-David, is there a specific reason that Newton-Picard requires defining the space of differentiable maps? Or were you just experimenting with the definition?</p>

<p>I think what Jan-David wrote uses only the derivative of f at 0. The right-inverse assumptions are morally about the second derivative of f at zero, but the second derivative actually doesn't appear. This is a really technical stuff, relevant in situations where we actually don't want to try to handle more derivative. Jeremy, in the situation Jan-David has in mind, the equation f = 0 is a non-linear Cauchy-Riemann equation, on spaces of maps between manifolds, with some Sobolev regularity. This explain while this theorem looks a bit strange</p>

<p>But I can totally understand why he introduced differentiable maps. This is really the first move you want after defining <code>has_deriv</code></p>

<p>I mainly introduce differentiable maps in this way, because it worked nicely for the operator norm</p>

<p>I think the mean value inequality is a much better test for this. Here we really need a differentiable function. It would also need some stuff specific to dimension 1 (the mean value theorem).</p>

<p>I don't understand the comment about the operator norm</p>

<p>Well, the last thing I did with lean was putting the structure of a normed linear space on the set of bounded linear operators between normed spaces</p>

<p>Since copy and paste of that definition almost worked, I used it as a domain for the differential</p>

<p>That's definitely more than necessary</p>

<p>But handy if you want the differential at zero</p>
