<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="217807">@Freek Wiedijk</span> asked me for a list of compulsory undergraduate pure maths at Imperial College that is not yet in Lean. Compulsory pure modules comprise about half of the first two years at Imperial. This is the list in case anyone else is interested.</p>

Jordan Normal Form<br>
Cayley Hamilton theorem<br>
Dihedral Groups<br>
All of Complex Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Cauchy Riemann equations</li>
<li>Harmonic functions</li>
<li>Cauchy Integral formula</li>
<li>Laurent series</li>
<li>Complex power series</li>
<li>Residue theory</li>
<li>
<p>Conformal mappings<br>
Real analysis</p>

<p>Did we not knock up a proof of Cayley-Hamilton in that big summer project thing in 2018? It didn't make it into mathlib?</p>

<p>I don't remember that happening.</p>

<p>We definitely once knocked up a theory of dihedral groups at Xena because I remember about six people working on it at once in CoCalc ;-) At some point someone changed the definition and all the proofs instantly broke, and then lots of people all started fixing different ones at once :-) But for sure that didn't make it into mathlib.</p>

<p>Oh -- maybe it was det(AB)=det(A)det(B) that we did in 2018</p>

<p>I'm working on that PR and related things just now.  I will update the PR in the next few days.</p>
