<p>The problem with universes (which is the sole reason I didn't have a PR ready months ago) is that there are genuinely two different sorts of categories one needs in mathematics: "small categories", in which objects and morphisms live in the same fixed universe, and "large categories", in which objects get to live in one higher universe than the morphisms.</p>

<p>For a very long time in my pre-Lean mathematical career, I thought this wasn't such a big deal, but I've learnt better. :-)</p>

<p>(Briefly: we need large categories because all the basic algebra examples like <code>Types</code>, <code>Groups</code>, <code>PL</code>, etc are large. We need small categories because if you try thinking about any of the basic machinery in category theory, particularly taking limits, when you index over objects in a large category you find yourself having to move up the universe hierarchy over and over again, while when you index over objects in a small category you can stay at one level. Happily, one can get away with doing most of mathematics only having to index over a small category --- but not quite all, so eventually you need to admit that the universe parameter can vary across a development.)</p>

<p>So, how to implement this? We don't want to have parallel developments of small and large categories, because then we'd have at least 3 different types of functors (small to small, small to large, large to large -- large to small is just silly, of course :-), and lifts between these, and then more mess at the level of transformations, and it will all end badly.</p>

<p>The two options I considered were:</p>

<a name="127441133"></a>
<h4><a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/homeomorphisms/near/127441133" class="zl"><img src="https://leanprover-community.github.io/assets/img/zulip2.png" alt="view this post on Zulip"></a> <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/116395maths/46395homeomorphisms.html#127441133">Scott Morrison (Jun 01 2018 at 22:23)</a>:</h4>
<p>1) "categories" by default have objects in <code>Type (u+1)</code> and morphisms in <code>Type u</code>, and a small category is a category along with the additional evidence that the objects are equivalent in something in <code>Type u</code> after all.</p>

<a name="127441186"></a>
<h4><a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/homeomorphisms/near/127441186" class="zl"><img src="https://leanprover-community.github.io/assets/img/zulip2.png" alt="view this post on Zulip"></a> <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/116395maths/46395homeomorphisms.html#127441186">Scott Morrison (Jun 01 2018 at 22:24)</a>:</h4>
<p>2) We define "categories" to have two universe parameters, so objects live in <code>Type u</code> and morphisms in <code>Type v</code>, and define "small_category" and "large_category" as subclasses (with <code>u=v</code> and <code>u=v+1</code> respectively).</p>

<p>In the end, it seems that 1) just doesn't work; I found that I was having to implement multiple sorts of functors and natural transformations anyway.</p>

<p>2) mostly works. You develop as much as you need at the level of "independent universe" categories, but then when it makes sense restrict to either <code>small_category</code> or <code>large_category</code>. Working entirely with independent universe categories becomes problematic, because Lean usually can't infer the morphism universe level. Mostly you can get around this just by specifying that level explicitly, but it also starts to break typeclass inference and so eventually becomes a serious problem.</p>
