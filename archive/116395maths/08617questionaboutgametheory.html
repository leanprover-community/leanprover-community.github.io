<p>Anyone here know the basics of combinatorial game theory? I don't understand why chess is not an impartial game. I want to consider chess as consisting of a normal chess board, along with a two-sided token, with sides black and white, which starts white side up. On each turn, a player moves a piece of the colour shown on the token (according to the usual rules of chess), and then flips the token over.</p>

<p>This interpretation of chess behaves differently under sum of games than "normal chess" does, but nevertheless, it still seems to be a perfectly reasonable description of chess as an impartial game...?</p>

<p>It's not an impartial game because the winner of the game is "the person controlling the black pieces" or "the person controlling the white pieces", not "the person who happens to have made a move corresponding to to black when black won the game" or anything like that.</p>

<p>But in Scott's <code>Chess'</code> it is just the last player who could make a valid move that wins. You lose if you can't make a valid move.</p>

<p>Another example could be "tic-tac-toe" or "noughts-and-crosses" as an impartial game. Again there is a token (labelled "noughts" and "crosses" on the two sides) which is flipped after each move. On a players turn, if there is not already a line of three marks of the opposite symbol already on the board, they must add one mark of the current symbol to an unfilled square.</p>

<p>I think that is an impartial description of noughts and crosses. (Except that all draws are converted into 1st player wins, because whoever goes second in a drawn game will have no where to put their 5th mark.)</p>

<p>Notice that these games behave very differently under sum of games than the usual versions of chess and noughts and crosses do, which is I think why people don't usually say they are impartial.</p>

<p>If you just regard a game like nim or noughts and crosses as a finite tree of possibilities (and make up some arbitrary rule as to who wins in the event of a tie in noughts and crosses) then of course you can evaluate every position, when considered a regular 2-player game, as a winning or a losing position, and then you can assign nimbers to every node on the tree and there you have it, nim theory applies. This would work for any game for which the game tree is finite. So in this weak sense every game is equivalent to an impartial game.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> I think Scott is trying to use <em>transport of structure</em>. He has an equiv <code>X =~ Y</code>. Both sides are games, and the equiv seems to respect structure. One of them is impartial, so the other should also be impartial. That's our promise, our mathematician's honour code, right?</p>

<p>But this is a step in the wrong direction, at least as far as combinatorial game theory goes. You can drop requirements about the normal play rule, you can consider games with "scores" such as dots and boxes, where the winner is not the player who moves last but the player with the biggest score -- all these games are just people wandering around a game tree, and every game tree can be made into an impartial game, but then I think you're throwing away the structure which Conway et al want to analyse.</p>

<p>okay -- but on the "score" issue --- don't you just say that there is a second phase in dots and boxes, where we take turns "counting" our captured squares? (so whoever captured fewer loses once they don't have a next one to count?)</p>

<p>The way chess or dots and boxes are played normally does not conform with the impartial combinatorial game theory story, but there's nothing to stop you playing them that way. They just become different games, so combinatorial game theory applied in this way will tell you nothing about chess played the usual way</p>

<p>The difference between Elkies' analysis and what Scott is suggesting is that Elkies is considering the game in the following form: if black chooses to play in another game then white can choose to play a move on the board with their white pieces, even if white played last. With Scott's modification the moves would be forced to alternate. In the unlikely event that a game of chess does split up into two completely independent subgames then it's Elkies' interpretation which would be the correct one.</p>

<p>By the way, Elkies' claim that combinatorial game theory has something to say about dots and boxes has not really stood the test of time. Many of the top players now know nothing at all about combinatorial game theory, they just know Euler's formula.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to us, however, that mathematics has now reached the stage where<br>
formalisation within some particular axiomatic set theory is irrelevant,<br>
even for foundational studies. It should be possible to specify conditions on a<br>
mathematical theory which would suffice for embeddability within ZF<br>
(supplemented by additional axioms of infinity if necessary), but which do<br>
not otherwise restrict the possible constructions in that theory. Of course the<br>
conditions would apply to ZF itself, and to other possible theories that have<br>
been proposed as suitable foundations for mathematics (certain theories of<br>
categories, etc.), but would not restrict us to any particular theory. This<br>
appendix is in fact a cry for a Mathematicians' Liberation Movement!<br>
Among the permissible kinds of construction we should have:<br>
(i) Objects may be created from earlier objects in any reasonably con-<br>
constructive fashion.<br>
(ii) Equality among the created objects can be any desired equivalence<br>
relation.</p>

<p>From ONAG, appendix to part 0. (i) says he wants a calculus of inductive constructions. (ii) says he wants to be able to transport certain constructions along equivalence relations. That's what I want too.</p>

<p>I think we'd want to define <code>list.map_mem</code>, to get the <code>sizeof</code> inequalities. Something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>def list.map_mem {α β : Type} : Π (L : list α) (f : Π a : α, a ∈ L → β), list β
| [] f := []
| L@(h :: t) f := f h (by simp) :: (list.map_mem t (λ a h, f a (or.inr h)))

def add : game → game → game
| G₁@(game.intro L₁ R₁) G₂@(game.intro L₂ R₂) :=
  game.intro
    (L₁.map_mem(λ G h, add G G₂) ++ L₂.map_mem(λ G h, add G₁ G))
    (R₁.map_mem(λ G h, add G G₂) ++ R₂.map_mem(λ G h, add G₁ G))

<p>I successfully defined addition of games using the definition above, and a very hackish tactic to proving monotonicity of the recursion.</p>

<p>Presumably a generic version of <code>lemma game.sizeof_mem (L : list game) (G : game) (h : G ∈ L) : game.sizeof G &lt; sizeof L :=</code> is already available somewhere?</p>

<p>Hmm. <code>game</code> is a proper class, so Cantor's diagonal argument does not apply.</p>

<p>Have you heard of the hypergame paradox? There is actually a contradiction lurking, and it has to do with thinking that there is only one type of all games. Saying it's a proper class doesn't save you, it only reinterprets what <code>set game</code> means</p>

<p>right -- I don't want to allow an arbitrary collection of games -- only collections "small enough to be sets".</p>

<p>I think you have to do some kind of <code>pSet</code> like construction to get that</p>

<p>it seems pretty essentially set-theoretic</p>
