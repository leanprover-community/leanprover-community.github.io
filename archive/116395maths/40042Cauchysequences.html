<p>If I understand correctly, for now, in mathlib, there are Cauchy filters, and a notion named <code>cau_seq</code> but defined on rings and with respect to some absolute value, but not the classical notion of Cauchy sequence in metric spaces (which is simply <code>cauchy (at_top.map u)</code> where <code>u</code> is a sequence from ℕ to some metric or even uniform space). And neither is the fact that a metric space is complete iff every Cauchy sequence converges, right?</p>
<p>Would it make sense to use <code>cau_seq_abv</code> for the slightly exotic <code>cau_seq</code> above, and to use <code>cau_seq</code> for the usual notion? I fear there would be some duplication with the current <code>cau_seq</code>, but I do not see how it could be avoided without a big refactoring.</p>

<p>When you prove completeness of a metric space, you really want to restrict to sequences. For instance, the completeness of <code>L^p</code> is proved by taking a converging series, arguing about the almost sure convergence, and then deducing convergence in <code>L^p</code> using some monotone convergence theorem. This is a subtle proof, and it really goes through sequences, not filters :)</p>

<p>Any fact like "in order to check P for all X you only need to check it for X of a special form Y" is a good fact which we should have. I think we don't have this for checking completeness of metric spaces in terms of sequences, and we should.</p>

<p>But I'm also not convinced by your monotone convergence example. There are quite a lot of theorems in metric space theory that are stated on sequences just because that's the tool you have, even though they would be easier expressed with filters</p>

<p>First countable is only talking about neighborhoods of points that exist in the space. If you imagine a first countable complete uniform space, except for a point <code>x</code> that can not be reached by countable sequences, and you remove this point, then the new space will still be first countable, all Cauchy sequences will converge, and still it will not be complete. The good condition would rather be that the uniformity is countably generated, but we have no type class for this, and I do not see real life examples where it would be useful to have this generalization.</p>
<p>For the completeness of <code>L^p</code>, let me insist that this is really something which is proved by sequences (contrary to many statements in metric spaces that could be proved more easily with filters, I completely agree with you about that). With more details, the proof goes as follows. Take a Cauchy sequences <code>u n</code>. Extract a subsequence <code>v n</code> such that the distance from <code>v n</code>to <code>v(n+1)</code> is at most <code>2^{-n}</code>. Form the series <code>V = \sum \abs(v_{n+1} - v_n)</code>. Check that it has finite integral. In particular, it is almost everywhere finite. Then the series <code>v = \sum (v_{n+1} - v_n)</code> is also defined almost everywhere. Moreover, by dominated convergence (using the dominating function <code>V</code>), <code>v n</code> tends to <code>v</code> in <code>L^p</code>. Finally, our original Cauchy sequence <code>u n</code> has a converging subsequence, hence it converges.</p>

<p>Well, the proof of completeness from sequential completeness is not really trivial: the version written by Robert Lewis takes roughly 150 lines. And the main point is to extract a sequence from a filter. Extracting a subsequence from a Cauchy sequence should take 5 lines, at most 10. But maybe this simply shows that Robert was not perfectly efficient in its filter use (and I certainly would not have been more efficient), I can not say for sure. What I can say for sure is that, the day a mathematician who is not completely familiar with the filters library wants to prove the completeness of some Sobolev or Hardy space, say, he will be extremely happy to have the sequential criterion!</p>

<p>The one in <code>data.real.cau_seq_filter</code> that my pull request #PR435 refactors. By the way, I have edited my branch to remove the leftover statements, and answered your comment on this PR, but nothing shows up on the PR page. Is github more or less down?</p>

<p>I was having some issues with GH a few hours ago, status says the DB is undergoing some "repairs"</p>

<p>I think the proof can be simplified a bit, but I will work from your version rather than Rob's if you've already refactored it</p>

<p>in particular I notice <code>cauchy_of_metric</code> is never used, which would simplify things</p>

<p>(at least in <code>cauchy_of_filter_cauchy</code> and converse)</p>

<p>In my PR, I have in <code>metric_space.lean</code> a statement <code>cauchy_seq_metric</code> expressing Cauchy sequences purely in metric terms, and using <code>cauchy_of_metric</code>, so <code>cauchy_of_filter_cauchy</code>and converse  should become essentially trivial.</p>

<p>what is this <code>topo_metric</code> thing?</p>

<p>also <code>cauchy_seq_metric</code> should have a trivial proof if you prove the behavior of the at_top quantifier</p>

<p><code>topo_metric</code> means I consider maps from a topological space to a metric space. What would be a better name? <code>topo_to_metric</code> is bad as it seems to imply that we are converting a topology to a metric...</p>
