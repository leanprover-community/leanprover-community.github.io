<p>Yesterday I was trying to find Hensel's lemma, and I was somewhat surprised to find it under <code>data/</code>. I would have expected that theorems and lemmas about the <code>padic</code>s would be in <code>ring_theory/</code> or something like that. Is there a reason to put Hensel's lemma in <code>data/</code>, or is it just there because all the other p-adic stuff is there as well?</p>

<p>No good reason. The other <code>padic</code> files are just as much <code>data</code> as <code>data.real</code> is data, and they all went in the same directory.</p>

<p>Sure, I understand why the other files are there.</p>

<p>Anyway, doesn't matter too much to me. Only trying to understand the conventions.</p>

<p>I think <code>data.padic.basic</code> should set up the type itself, and the operations, and prove it's a field etc., and everything else should go in another folder, like <code>number_theory</code> or <code>ring_theory</code></p>
