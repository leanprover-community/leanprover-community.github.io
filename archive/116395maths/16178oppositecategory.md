<p>I also had some difficulty using <code>opposite</code>. If I have a contravariant functor <code>F : C\op \func D</code> and a map <code>f : a \hom b</code> in <code>C</code> then how am I supposed to write the induced map <code>F b \hom F a</code>? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> have you already encountered this?</p>
