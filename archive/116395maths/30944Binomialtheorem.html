<p>Hey! I proved the binomial theorem, if anyone finds it interesting its in a gist here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/MonoidMusician/ad43301ee3b4e71c0e1c3d440c6898c5" target="_blank" title="https://gist.github.com/MonoidMusician/ad43301ee3b4e71c0e1c3d440c6898c5">https://gist.github.com/MonoidMusician/ad43301ee3b4e71c0e1c3d440c6898c5</a></p>

<p>just curious: is there an existing definition of the binomial coefficient anywhere, maybe with some lemmas? I couldn't find one</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> did this but I'm not sure it ever made it into mathlib. I think Chris did pretty much everything in my introduction to proof course. He even did the multinomial theorem (I think this is one of the reasons he's so good at finite stuff :-) )</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111651">@Nicholas Scheel</span> , it would be great to PR this into mathlib. (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span>, too :-)</p>

<p>The main reason I didn't do this, is we don't have a sensible definition of sums between naturals yet.</p>

<p>You mean sums from a to b? Mario always argued that you should do sums from a to a+b (or perhaps a+b-1) and seeing the troubles Patrick had when summing from a to b I am inclined to take Mario's word for it. I know from years of worrying about this sort of thing that I'm completely happy to see a sum from i to j if (and only if) j&gt;=i-1, but if j&lt;i-1 then I always feel something has gone wrong.</p>

<p>I'm just waiting for some definition to end up in the library. I actually needed non commutative products for Sylow, so it would be useful if Patrick PRed his big operators.</p>

<p>I'm sorry I don't have a lot of time for Lean, and it seemed more fun to jump on the perfectoid train because it means team work. But help is very much welcome on the bigop front.</p>

<p>Last time I looked you were doing great with the bigop thing, there didn't seem to be any problems like there were with type class inference for the modules, and I was just leaving you to do it. Then you went back to the normed vector spaces and had type class problems again, which to be honest was a bit depressing, all I remember was the CS people talking about how interesting out_param was. What is the current state of the bigop stuff?</p>

<p>I got tired of nat substraction mainly, especially since <code>cooper</code> seems to promise to make all this easier</p>
