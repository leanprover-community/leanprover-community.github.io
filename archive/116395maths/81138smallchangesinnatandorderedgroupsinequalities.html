<p>Proposal 1.</p>
<p>The following lemma is useful:</p>
<p><code>nat.le_add_right : ∀ (n k : ℕ), n ≤ n + k</code></p>
<p>could we have the following lemma in mathlib:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>def  nat.le_add_right_of_le:  ∀ (n m k : nat) (n_le_m : n &lt;= m), n &lt;= m + k
    | n m 0 n_le_m := n_le_m
    | n m (k +  1) n_le_m := nat.le_succ_of_le (nat.le_add_right_of_le n m k n_le_m)
</pre></div>


<p>Proposal 2.</p>
<p>Can we rename <code>lt_add_of_pos_of_lt</code> to  <code>lt_add_right_of_pos_of_lt</code> and <code>lt_add_of_lt_of_pos</code> <code>lt_add_left_of_lt_of_pos</code>?  Can we perhaps make things more standard, and change the signature of <code>lt_add_of_lt_of_pos</code> and rename it to <code>lt_add_of_pos_of_lt</code>?</p>
<p>Proposal 3.</p>
<p>Can we have this in mathlib: <code>def  nat.le_mul_right_of_le_of_pos:  ∀ (n m k : nat) (n_le_m : n &lt;= m) (k_pos : 0  &lt; k), n &lt;= m * k :=  sorry</code> (I haven't tried proving it yet, but I assume induction should work too quite straightforwardly). Perhaps we would want a more general result too in <code>ordered_group.lean</code>, i.e. <code>le_mul_right_of_le_of_pos</code>?</p>

<p>Just to comment that <code>theorem  nat.le_add_right_of_le (n m k : nat) (n_le_m : n &lt;= m) : n &lt;= m + k := le_trans n_le_m $ nat.le_add_right _ _</code></p>

<p>Things like <code>lt_add_of_pos_of_lt</code> are in the core lean library and it's very difficult currently to change anything in the core library, as the devs are busy with Lean 4 and are not amenable to "minor" changes like this. When Lean 4 hits a bunch of maths might be moved out of the core library and this might be the time to change these things. However I really want a place where comments such as this can sit festering until the devs are ready; it's difficult to find such a place as you can see from the Lean FAQ that opening minor issues is currently not really welcome.</p>

<p>Proposal 3 also looks like a case for transitivity, because it's naturally the conjunction of <code>n &lt;=m</code> and <code>m &lt;= m * k</code></p>

<p>Thanks, I didn't realise that these were from standard library. I thought it was in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/d84dfb17b9cfbb29e0f728fd22b4f5176f7bd0a9/algebra/ordered_group.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/d84dfb17b9cfbb29e0f728fd22b4f5176f7bd0a9/algebra/ordered_group.lean">mathlib in ordered_group.lean</a>, but actually it is in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/51a87212fa30883bc8f39b41fc9ed2bed1cfed77/library/init/algebra/ordered_group.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/51a87212fa30883bc8f39b41fc9ed2bed1cfed77/library/init/algebra/ordered_group.lean">standard library ordered_group.lean</a>. It appears that many lemmas are copied over to mathlib from standard library, but they appear with a single apostrophe at the end in mathlib!</p>
<p>I think you're talking about a place to keep the backlog. I've seen people using trello boards for this purpose. I've set one up for this:<br>
<a href="https://trello.com/b/we2kRiDw/lean-4-proposals" target="_blank" title="https://trello.com/b/we2kRiDw/lean-4-proposals">https://trello.com/b/we2kRiDw/lean-4-proposals</a></p>
<p>I've added you to it. Happy to add everybody else if this is what we want to use? If a different solution catches on, I can migrate these proposals over.</p>

<p>The "apostrophe lemmas" have a different typeclass assumption, namely <code>ordered_comm_group</code>, which doesn't exist in core</p>

<p>in an ideal world the core lemmas would be removed since you get them from the mathlib lemmas by typeclass inference, but core lib is basically frozen for now</p>

<p>Do apostrophed lemmas somehow shadow non-apostrophed lemmas? Certainly vscode doesn't autosuggest them for me.</p>

<p>No, that sort of shadowing isn't allowed by lean. You have to have the file imported to see them in autosuggest</p>

<p>One possibility is a "core lib wishlist" file we can maintain on mathlib. I used <code>pending.lean</code> for this briefly, but I've since become convinced that Leo is unlikely to ever accept a change from mathlib, so I have spent most of my time working around core as it exists rather than trying to change it. Such a wishlist may become useful if we ever fork lean, but I don't see what other good it would do.</p>

<p>Sounds a bit nuclear. Surely there must be a way for mathlib and stdlib to work closely together? Are main goals/objectives of lean and mathlib different?</p>

<p>Trust me, this isn't what I want, but Leo has gone hermit in a big way and we have to work around this if we want to keep using and improving lean</p>

<p>For now I'm keeping the possibility open but not making any steps towards a fork until it becomes absolutely necessary</p>

<p>I really hope Lean 4 and its reduced core lib will make all these problem disappear</p>
