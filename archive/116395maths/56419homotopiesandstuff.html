<p>What is the state of algebraic topology in mathlib?</p>
<p>I was recently looking at some stuff about covering spaces for an undergrad project, and looked around mathlib to see what has been formalised &amp; how it's been done. Surprisingly, I didn't find many things that I recognised.</p>
<p>A search for some relevant words on zulip and in the commit history turned up a few instances of conversations about doing things like the homotopy groups or simplicial complexes (such as <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/simplicial.20complexes.20in.20lean/near/148191703" title="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/simplicial.20complexes.20in.20lean/near/148191703">here</a>, but the branch it links to doesn't exist anymore,) and also <a href="https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory">this separate repository</a> from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>  which contains a lot of cool stuff.</p>
<p>Is there any work currently being done on getting this stuff into mathlib? In particular, are there any things that an interested but relatively-new-to-all-of-this student like me could possibly start doing that might be helpful?</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any formalization of covering space theory. I certainly haven't done it. I think it would make a great project.</p>

<p>I actually meant to sit down at some point and sketch out a spec of what would be involved to check how feasible it is in the current state of mathlib.</p>
