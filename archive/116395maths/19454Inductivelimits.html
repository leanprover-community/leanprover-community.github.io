<p>What is the current status of inductive limits with respect to mathlib? I have a sequence of isometric embeddings <code>i n : C n -&gt; C (n+1)</code> for <code>n : nat</code>, and I want to get the inductive limit as a metric space in which all <code>C n</code> embed isometrically. I can definitely do it by hand, but if the direct limit in <code>Set</code> is already there it might be fun to try to use it. And if mathlib is ready for a categoric framework with metric spaces as objects and isometric embeddings as maps, why not!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/category_theory/limits/types.lean#L49" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/category_theory/limits/types.lean#L49">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/category_theory/limits/types.lean#L49</a> has the colimit of a general diagram of types. You can specialize the index category to <code>nat</code> (which is a poset, and therefore automatically a category).<br>
I also have the more specific description of the equivalence relation on a filtered colimit of types in a form which is more or less ready to PR.</p>

<p>Do you know the joke that, when you ask a question to a category theorist and you listen to his answer, then after that you don't understand your own question any more? :)</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't know what a cocone is, or a colimit, but I would very much like to see how the general framework works in a super-concrete setting just like the one I asked, on <code>Set</code>.</p>

<p>Btw, for what I am asking #PR585 by Kenny would be very useful.</p>

<p>inductive limits are special cases of colimits</p>

<p>And a cocone is the thing that shows up in the statement of the universal property: another object together with compatible maps from all the objects in the diagram (the <code>C n</code>).</p>

<p>Is the statement you need just that there exists a metric space in which all the <code>C n</code> embed isometrically and compatibly with the give maps <code>i n</code>?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, exactly. Note that the category of metric spaces and isometric embeddings is not really well behaved, for instance if you have two embeddings FY : X -&gt; Y and FZ : X -&gt; Z, then there are several non-isometric ways to complete the square, but there is a maximal one, so universal properties would be expressed in terms of 1-Lipschitz maps instead of isometries.<br>
But for limits along <code>nat</code> everything is fine (as the embeddings are injection, it is just an increasing sequence of spaces, and you take the union)</p>
