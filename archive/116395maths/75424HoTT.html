<p>Here's a message I just posted to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/homotopytypetheory" target="_blank" title="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/homotopytypetheory">homotopy type theory google group forum</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi from a Lean user.</p>
<p>As many people here will know, Tom Hales' formal abstracts project <a href="https://formalabstracts.github.io/" target="_blank" title="https://formalabstracts.github.io/">https://formalabstracts.github.io/</a> wants to formalise many of the statements of modern pure mathematics in Lean. One could ask more generally about a project of formalising many of the statements of modern pure mathematics in an arbitrary system, such as HoTT. I know enough about the formalisation process to know that whatever system one chooses, there will be pain points, because some mathematical ideas fit more readily into some foundational systems than others.</p>
<p>I have seen enough of Lean to become convinced that the pain points would be surmountable in Lean. I have seen enough of Isabelle/HOL to become skeptical about the idea that it would be suitable for all of modern pure mathematics, although it is clearly suitable for some of it; however it seems that simple type theory struggles to handle things like tensor products of sheaves of modules on a scheme, because sheaves are dependent types and it seems that one cannot use Isabelle's typeclass system to handle the rings showing up in a sheaf of rings.</p>
<p>I have very little experience with HoTT. I have heard that the fact that "all constructions must be isomorphism-invariant" is both a blessing and a curse. However I would like to know more details. I am speaking at the Big Proof conference in Edinburgh this coming Wednesday on the pain points involved with formalising mathematical objects in dependent type theory and during the preparation of my talk I began to wonder what the analogous picture was with HoTT.</p>
<p>Everyone will have a different interpretation of "modern pure mathematics" so to fix our ideas, let me say that for the purposes of this discussion, "modern pure mathematics" means the statements of the theorems publishsed by the Annals of Mathematics over the last few years, so for example I am talking about formalising statements of theorems involving L-functions of abelian varieties over number fields, Hodge theory, cohomology of algebraic varieties, Hecke algebras of symmetric groups, Ricci flow and the like; one can see titles and more at <a href="http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2019/189-3" target="_blank" title="http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2019/189-3">http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2019/189-3</a> . Classical logic and the axiom of choice are absolutely essential -- I am only interested in the hard-core "classical mathematician" stance of the way mathematics works, and what it is.</p>
<p>If this is not the right forum for this question, I would be happily directed to somewhere more suitable. After spending 10 minutes failing to get onto ##hott on freenode ("you need to be identified with services") I decided it was easier just to ask here. If people want to chat directly I am usually around at <a href="" target="_blank" title="">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/</a> (registration required, full names are usually used, I'll start a HoTT thread in #mathematics).</p>

<p>Does anyone here have enough experience with HoTT to say anything? I've asked here questions like "what would the pain points be if one tried to formalise a scheme in HoTT?" and have got answers of the form "if you want to find out, you should go ahead and try". I'm not sure I have time to learn another system though. I have even dumber questions -- how would one define the trace of a linear map from a finite-dimensional vector space to itself? A mathematician would pick a basis, compute the trace of the corresponding matrix, and then note that it was independent of the choice. Is this problematic in HoTT?</p>

<p>I suppose it will depend on exactly how you define "finite-dimensional vector space". If it's defined as a vector space together with <code>trunc</code> of a basis, then the procedure for defining the trace of a map goes exactly how you describe.</p>

<p><code>trunc</code> is called the "propositional truncation" in HoTT although "proposition" there more closely corresponds to what Lean calls <code>subsingleton</code></p>

<p>In particular, this definition is constructive. However you would probably need the axiom of choice to prove that a quotient of a finite dimensional vector space is again finite dimensional.</p>

<p>Or maybe LEM is enough, but that's still an uncomputable axiom</p>

<p>I haven't actually used a HoTT-based theorem prover yet, only read the book. I do find it difficult to get a sense of how HoTT+choice would work in practice. I think this is a cultural phenomenon: there tends to be overlap between people interested in HoTT and people interested in constructive logic. (Consider that the same could be said about Coq, yet Lean is based on essentially the same underlying type theory and look where we are now.)</p>

<p>The HoTT people really embrace the D in DTT, and when you work like that the exact details of definitional equality matter a lot; but there is not a uniform conception of what it should be, so you end up with a bunch of incompatible axiomatizations</p>

<p>I mean formalizing even relatively basic constructions like this one that (apparently) require choice.<br>
I'm pretty sure that this is possible in HoTT (plus choice). In either HoTT or Lean you must first prove that X is finite dimensional (has a finite basis); that part will go the same way. In HoTT you will also need to prove that the trace is independent of the choice of basis, which is not a bad thing.</p>

<p>In HoTT if I define what it means for a ring to be local, would I have to prove that a ring isomorphic to a local ring is local before I can even make the definition?</p>

<p>I think a first approximation to how choice works in HoTT, expressed in the language of Lean, is that one can no longer have <code>choice : nonempty X -&gt; X</code>, but one still has</p>
<ul>
<li><code>unique_choice : nonempty X -&gt; trunc X</code>, which means that you can extract a witness for an existential to construct something provided you can prove the result doesn't depend on the choice of witness, and</li>
<li><code>axiom_of_choice : (∀ x, ∃ y, r x y) -&gt; ∃ f, ∀ x, r x (f x)</code></li>

<p>Here's my two cents:<br>
The main advantage univalence gives us from a formalization perspective is that it allows for implementation irrelevance.

<p>If we do "fabstracts in HoTT", then it would mean that we could formalize a single definition for each mathematical statement and that would, by univalence, be akin to formalizing a whole equivalence class of such definitions. (<em>upto homotopy</em>)</p>

<p>I'm late to the party, but here are some of my responses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the construction of the Serre SS use any axioms?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, only univalence and higher inductive types. In HoTT there is a very strong sense of "trying to avoid the axiom of choice". And if you care about that (which mathematicians of course don't), there are some nice new things you can do with HoTT to avoid axioms:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can elimination from the propositional truncation (which is like <code>nonempty</code>) to any subsingleton type without using an axiom. In Lean you would use <code>choice</code> for this.</li>
<li>Normally, if you define the real numbers as Cauchy sequences, you need the (countable) axiom of choice to prove completeness of the real numbers. In HoTT there is a definition of the Cauchy real numbers as a higher inductive type where you can prove completeness without the axiom of choice (you still need choice to prove that it is equivalent to the Dedekind real numbers).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not to say you cannot add the axiom of choice to HoTT and work classically. This is very much possible. However, as Reid mentions you cannot add <code>classical.choice</code> (that is inconsistent with univalence), you need the weaker set-theoretic formulation of choice (e.g. every surjection has a section).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what would the pain points be if one tried to formalise a scheme in HoTT?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the pain points much more depend on which proof assistant you use, and more importantly: which tactics and automation is available. One example of a pain point when doing HoTT in Lean 2 which are specific to HoTT, is that - for example - I had to prove that the ordering on the natural numbers is a proposition (subsingleton): <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/hott/types/nat/hott.hlean#L14" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/hott/types/nat/hott.hlean#L14">https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/hott/types/nat/hott.hlean#L14</a></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>definition is_prop_le [instance] (n m : ℕ) : is_prop (n ≤ m)
</pre></div>


<p>A much bigger pain point is that univalence doesn't compute in Lean 2, so if you want a function you define to compute definitionally (and in Lean 2 we wanted that, partially because of the lack of a good <code>simp</code>), then you want to avoid using univalence. This made me define many many concepts explicitly which I could have defined using univalence.</p>

<p>One mentality problem in HoTT is that everything - even proofs of propositions - are definitions and it sometimes matters how you define/prove them, especially if you use dependent types heavily. For example, if you have a sequence of maps <code>X 0 -&gt; X 1 -&gt; X 2 -&gt; ...</code> then you can define a function <code>n &lt;= m -&gt; X n -&gt; X m</code>. In HoTT you can define this function by recursion on the proof that <code>n &lt;= m</code>, and so how that function computes depends on how you have proven that <code>n &lt;= m</code> (for numerals <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> there is only 1 way to do this, but for variables there could be different ways, of course). At one point, I reproved some inequalities of natural numbers to make this function compute better (and it was important that it computed better because I was using dependent types).</p>

<p>What do you mean by usable?</p>
<ul>
<li>Usable for doing HoTT? Yes, although most proof assistants implementing univalence are pretty experimental and lack high-level features.</li>
<li>Usable for computation of univalence? Yes, it can compute univalence. Although with complicated proofs, the computation is inefficient, so you will have to optimize your proof for efficient computation.</li>
<li>Usable for doing ordinary mathematics? Probably not really.</li>

<p>Their paper says their p-adics are constructive. One way to interpret the computability question is to ask if they can define computable functions on the p-adics. For example, given a closed term of Z_p you might want to compute its norm. As far as I could tell, they don't define any functions beyond the arithmetic ones, computably or noncomputably. And univalence doesn't compute in UniMath. That may or may not show up to block things here, I don't know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that all constructions are homotopy invariant also leads to some challenges.<br>
It is not always clear whether we can define a concept of homotopy theory in homotopy<br>
type theory. For example, singular homology is a homotopy invariant notion, but in the<br>
construction we use the set of all simplices in a space, which is not a homotopy invariant<br>
notion. In this case, we can define homology in a different way (see Section 5.5).<br>
However, for other definitions, such as the Grassmannian manifolds, it is an open<br>
problem whether they can be constructed in homotopy type theory.</p>

<p>Wait--what? Are we just talking about the standard smooth projective varieties of e.g. subspaces of a f.d. vector space? What is the trouble with making them in HoTT?</p>

<p>The problem is to construct HoTT types whose "internal homotopy type" is the homotopy type of a real or complex Grassmannian.<br>
Here "internal homotopy type of X" means, for example, use the interpretation of HoTT in simplicial sets and take the homotopy type of the simplicial set corresponding to X.</p>

<p>Of course you can also reinvent the real numbers, classical topology, linear algebra, etc. in HoTT just the same way you would do in Lean and define Grassmannians that way, but there's no known way in book HoTT to relate this classical homotopy theory to the internal homotopy theory.</p>

<p>So HoTT is a way of making the "basic objects" Kan complexes. And it feels to me that Lean is a way of making the basic objects into non-intersecting sets. So if you want to do some parts of homotopy theory then HoTT is a really good way to do it because the basic objects are so close to the objects you want to model. But it sounds like a less good way of doing all mathematics, because Lean's types seem to me to be closer to the kind of objects that mathematicians use. Are there people out there who would argue that I am wrong here and I should be thinking of Z/6Z or the p-adic numbers as some sort of space?</p>

<p>Z/6Z no; of course you already think of the p-adic numbers as some kind of space--it's not the kind of space that HoTT helps you with, but another flavor of type theory might</p>

<p>Anyways in HoTT you can always impose a condition that makes a type X into a genuine set: namely <code>isSet X := \Pi (a b : X) (e f : a = b), e = f</code></p>

<p>It seems to me that I have lost the ability to rewrite, and this extra condition is some attempt to put it back again. Hmm. Maybe what I'm saying is that I have lost <code>Prop</code>, and one can attempt to make it again, but I bet in practice it's not as good as my beloved Lean <code>Prop</code>.</p>

<p>and then manually use <code>isSet</code> where you would in Lean rely on proof irrelevance--and then you get only a propositional equality and not a definitional one. It doesn't seem very ergonomic to me, but I've never tried to use it myself.</p>

<p>My attempt over the last couple of weeks to understand HoTT has taken some of the gloss off it. I think I'd rather have a <code>transfer</code> tactic than lose all this other stuff. The <code>transfer</code> tactic seems accessible to me.</p>

<p>Now you could probably design a system with both HoTT-style types and sets, or more generally track the "h-level" of a type (= how truncated it is) the same way Lean tracks universe levels, it just doesn't exist yet as far as I know</p>

<p>I see. So one could imagine some future version of Leo coming along with a new model, a slightly different kind of type theory which was perhaps some way between Lean and HoTT, which worked even better for mathematics, and then we'd all have to start again?</p>

<p>It seems to me that for "normal mathematicians" (i.e. mathematicians who don't know anything about type theory or set theory or category theory), vanilla Lean 3 is currently the best option for formalising "all normal maths" on a computer. HOL has no dependent types so just isn't flexible enough for algebra (although it's very good at analysis) and HoTT is great at homotopy theory but lacks a decent implementation in a computer system. Mizar seems to be dead, for some reason, so that leaves Coq, Lean and Agda, and Lean is somehow better than the other two because it was written later on so has learnt from the mistakes of the earlier systems (quotients, term mode and tactic mode, ...)</p>

<p>Why? If you want to reason about complicated objects which have an analytic construction but not a synthetic one then you should figure out what extra properties you need from the analytic construction which don't "come for free" via some formal synthetic argument, right?</p>

<p>I just can't get away from the fact that HoTT is making a tool which makes some parts of homotopy theory very nice. What about the rest of maths? It's like Isabelle/HOL with its real analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cubicaltt is based on a novel type theory called Cubical Type Theory that provides new ways to reason about equality. Most notably it makes various extensionality principles, like function extensionality and Voevodsky’s univalence axiom, into theorems instead of axioms. This is done such that these principles have computational content and in particular that we can transport structures between equivalent types and that these transports compute. This is different from when one postulates the univalence axiom in a proof assistant like Coq or Agda. If one just adds an axiom there is no way for Coq or Agda to know how it should compute and one looses the good computational properties of type theory. In particular canonicity no longer holds and one can produce terms that are stuck (e.g. booleans that are neither true nor false but don’t reduce further). In other words this is like having a programming language in which one doesn’t know how to run the programs. So cubicaltt provides an operational semantics for Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations by giving a computational justification for the univalence axiom and (some) higher inductive types.</p>

<p>It looks like the Agda cubical thing is a mode that Agda is aware of, so it probably automatically prevents you from breaking the rules (assuming there aren't bugs), like Lean 2's HoTT mode</p>

<p>This always seemed to me to be something that felt accidentally consistent. You have a recursor that says every proof is <code>refl</code>, but somehow you can't prove everything's a set. A lot of the proofs in the HoTT book informally prove equalities by saying "assume everything's refl". Is there some intuition behind when this is valid? Very imprecise question, I know.</p>

<p>So one thing I would like to attempt some day is to turn the Kapulkin-Lumsdaine paper that <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="116448">Koundinya Vajjha</span> linked earlier into Lean so that you can do the synthetic homotopy theory parts in an embedded HoTT language and the analytic parts with whatever means are necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AFAIK, synthetic homotopy theory uses Higher Inductive types and the Kapulkin-Lumsdaine paper avoids HITs altogether. As of last year, I think HITs have a semantics in the simplicial model, although I'm not totally sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This always seemed to me to be something that felt accidentally consistent. You have a recursor that says every proof is <code>refl</code>, but somehow you can't prove everything's a set. A lot of the proofs in the HoTT book informally prove equalities by saying "assume everything's refl". Is there some intuition behind when this is valid? Very imprecise question, I know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least one endpoint of the equality has to be a variable; then you can replace it and the equality proof by the other endpoint and <code>refl</code>. The intuition is that if you have a path in a space, if you're allowed to move one endpoint, then you can collapse the path down to a constant path, but if you're not allowed to then you can't. (Well that is kind of obvious, but the point is that even if the two endpoints are the same then the path might not be equal to the constant path.)</p>

<p>Some comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kevin Buzzard: So how's its [cubicaltt's] maths library?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is none, up to a rounding error. I doubt that the rational numbers are defined. Note that cubicaltt does not support implicit arguments, and yes, that is every bit as inconvenient as you think it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the easiest way of proving false using the Lean 3 HoTT package?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The claim of consistency of the Lean 3 HoTT library is that you cannot prove <code>false</code> in a declaration with the <code>@[hott]</code> attribute without generating a warning/error message. Without this attribute you can do it, as stated above (you have to prove that <code>hott.eq</code> and <code>eq</code> are equivalent).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is <code>tt == ff</code> in HoTT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If <code>==</code> is the <code>heq</code> analogue for HoTT, then yes. However, this is not in contradiction, since you cannot prove that if <code>x == y</code> and <code>x : A</code> and <code>y : A</code> then <code>x = y</code>. What this shows is that <code>heq</code> is not a useful notion in HoTT. Instead, we use pathovers: <a href="https://github.com/gebner/hott3/blob/master/src/hott/init/pathover.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/gebner/hott3/blob/master/src/hott/init/pathover.lean">https://github.com/gebner/hott3/blob/master/src/hott/init/pathover.lean</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>=</code> is overloaded! It's just like normal maths!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I recall correctly, local notation doesn't overload global notation, but replaces it. But now that I test it, that doesn't seem to be true. I'm quite sure it was never a problem (presumably because <code>hott.eq</code> always applies when <code>eq</code> does [for the use cases of HoTT].</p>

<p>With "large elimination" do you mean "singleton elimination" (the reason that <code>eq</code>, <code>acc</code>, <code>true</code> and similar inductive propositions/predicates can eliminate to <code>Type*</code> instead of just <code>Prop</code>)? Assuming you also remove choice and quotients, then I strongly suspect it is consistent, since in that case there is probably no way to go from <code>Prop</code> to <code>Type*</code>. In other words, if you can construct an element of a type, then I suspect you can construct that element without proving any proposition.</p>

<p>Some tactics are available.  For example, <code>cases</code> (and the equations compiler) works as long as the type you match on is not dependent (i.e., unit, prod, list are fine.  sigma, eq is bad).  Floris wrote an <code>hinduction</code> tactic that does induction on equalities.  There is also an <code>hsimp</code> tactic that adapts the simplifier to work on <code>hott.eq</code>.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/gebner/hott3/blob/64a297c4c1effa4886abcdc08dd88824a7b27455/src/hott/init/trunc.lean#L156-L161" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/gebner/hott3/blob/64a297c4c1effa4886abcdc08dd88824a7b27455/src/hott/init/trunc.lean#L156-L161">https://github.com/gebner/hott3/blob/64a297c4c1effa4886abcdc08dd88824a7b27455/src/hott/init/trunc.lean#L156-L161</a></p>
<p>The idea behind the proof is that you first want to define a "canonical" proof that any two elements in your type are equal (which is equal to refl when the two terms are definitionally equal), and then (using path/eq induction) proof that an arbitrary path/eq is equal to the canonical one.</p>
<p>You can also look in chapter 3 of the HoTT book (I think section 3.1) for a proof in words.</p>

<p>There are plenty of tactic proofs in the HoTT library: <a href="https://github.com/gebner/hott3/search?q=begin&amp;unscoped_q=begin" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/gebner/hott3/search?q=begin&amp;unscoped_q=begin">https://github.com/gebner/hott3/search?q=begin&amp;unscoped_q=begin</a></p>

<p>Here is one question that I've been wondering about:<br>
suppose that I formalise groups in HoTT. It would be something like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">group</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">G</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">set</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">is_a_set</span> <span class="n">G</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">mul</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">G</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">G</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">G</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">one</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">G</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">axioms</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">blah</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The difference is of course the addition of the <code>is_a_set</code> condition.</p>
<p>Now I formalise <code>Group</code> as bundled groups, and endow this with the obvious category structure. I then have isomorphisms in the category <code>Group</code>, but HoTT also gives me transport along paths. These two notions are mathematically the same. How hard is it to derive this in HoTT?</p>
