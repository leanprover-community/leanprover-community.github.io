<p>I just spent an hour proudly looking through the mathlib github repo and summarising the stuff that is there which a mathematician would recognise and think of as "standard" or "important" or whatever. The style of my summary is very much the same style as the course summaries for the courses I attended as an undergraduate. I completely skip all the foundational stuff (e.g. no mathematician wants to hear that we have finset and fintype and finsupp, they won't even understand what that means, these are just "obvious", and they also don't want to know about conditionally complete lattices or monoids because they don't understand their importance). The big question: did I miss anything which a mathematician would find "standard" or "important" or whatever, and which is not trivially implied by things I already wrote?</p>

<p>Do we have localisation of modules? I thought only of rings...</p>

<p>We have tensor products and localisation of rings, right?</p>

<p>I can move "localisation" to the rings sentence.</p>

<p>I think it would (currently) make sense to move it there</p>

<p>We only have tensor products of modules, not of rings, as far as I know</p>

<p>You mention differentiation of functions in one variable, but we also do several variables, so it is really <code>one or several variables</code>.</p>

<p>I didn't read anything -- thanks for these. I knew I would have missed several things. I just had a free hour and thought "I'm going to glance at every file"</p>
