<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> I'm curious why you reversed the direction of the arrows of <code>open_set</code>. I would rather put the contravariant-ness in the notion of (pre)sheaf.</p>

<p>Ah, I hadn't seen this, and asked your opinion elsewhere. I'll reverse it again when I get there.</p>

<p>Yes Scott mentioned this before I think. Maybe he said something like he had ops everywhere at all times with no obvious purpose?</p>

<p>I guess the point is that we never use the unopped category</p>

<p>Right, but once we start doing sheaves over sites we will want contravariant (pre)sheaves. And we also want those to specialise to "plain old" (pre)sheaves on open sets. So I vote for keeping the <code>op</code>.</p>

<p>Another question of course is where you want the <code>op</code> -- source or target. It's funny this is coming up now. I distinctly remember Scott saying "eew there are <code>op</code>s everywhere, but I've had a brilliant idea -- if we just redefine the open set category then they all go away and it's much easier to use" and it was one of those moments where I just thought "yeah, it's not ideal but I can completely see his point. It removes all of them at once."</p>
