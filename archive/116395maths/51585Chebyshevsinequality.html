<p>I'm working on some stuff and managed to prove the markov and chebyshev inequality. Is there any interest in adding these to mathlib? I ask this because I understand that the Bochner integral is on the way.</p>

<p>Certainly. Let's get probability measures and probability theory</p>

<p>I did have some elementary probability theory in a PR which was closed. I could try to chop it up a bit and resubmit. The main question there was if we wanted a probability measure which lands in <code>nnreal</code> or <code>ennreal</code>. What is the consensus on this now?</p>

<p>what is your personal consensus on that? Sounds like you've already found an answer</p>
