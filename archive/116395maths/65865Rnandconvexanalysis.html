<p>Is there a definition of <code>ℝ^n</code>  as a vector space in the library? I didn't see one, but I'll apologize in advance if I did not look hard enough. </p>
<p>There are lots of possible representations: <code>vector ℝ n</code>, <code>fin n → ℝ</code>, more generally <code>σ → ℝ</code> with <code>σ</code> a <code>fintype</code>, a recursively-defined iterated product, etc. Ultimately, I want it for convex analysis, which means that I need something that will work with matrices but can can also be instantiated as a normed space. (And I guess we will eventually have to grapple that there are various equivalent norms -- either the l1 or l2 norm will work.) That seems to speak for using <code>σ → ℝ</code> with <code>σ</code> a <code>fintype</code>.</p>
<p>Has anyone already done something along these lines? If not, what should I do?</p>

<p>If you're making heavy use of matrices, one option is an n by 1 matrix. That's what I've been using. I'm even using 1 by 1 matrices.</p>

<p>Thanks. Given <code>f : σ → ℝ</code>, we can use <code>matrix.col f</code> and <code>matrix.row f</code> to get an n by 1 matrix and a 1 by n matrix, respectively. And there are already casts, I think, from <code>fin n → ℝ</code> to and from <code>vector ℝ n</code>. I think the type <code>σ → ℝ</code> is already a vector space. <em>And</em> the norms on <code>σ → ℝ</code> are special cases of the L1 and L2 norms in measure theory (now that we have integration!). So all that also speaks to using <code>σ → ℝ</code> as the main representation: it is convenient to get to the others.</p>
