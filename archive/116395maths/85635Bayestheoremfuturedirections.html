<p>hello,</p>
<p>I have just completed a formalization of Bayes theorem building on top of the measure theory library. this was my first formalization effort so it is a bit rough around the edges and needs cleaning up.  <a href="https://github.com/kodyvajjha/mathlib/commit/54639f16ec9e6a646fe43d870131a6099e8a550c" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/kodyvajjha/mathlib/commit/54639f16ec9e6a646fe43d870131a6099e8a550c">https://github.com/kodyvajjha/mathlib/commit/54639f16ec9e6a646fe43d870131a6099e8a550c</a></p>
<p>i had set this target as a first milestone in formalizing the (G)ARCH time series models, and I wanted to ask the community if they had any tips/suggestions on getting there. as i understand it - matrices aren't yet formalized, are there any plans on getting to matrices in the near future?</p>

<p>Matrices are in <code>ring_theory/matrix</code></p>
