<p>So, after spending about two hours browsing through the standard library for the definition of a limit (among other things) and wrapping my head around the fact that limits are defined from a somewhat more general concept of filters (which I have no idea of as a CS major), I finally got down the following statement (named <code>SUBMISSION</code> in the code example below) which I <em>believe</em> should be logically equivalent to <code>0.999... = 1</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/-</span><span class="cm"> Preloaded.lean -/</span>

<p>I would like to ask for feedback on possible improvements (or corrections) to my formalization above. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any redundant <code>import</code>s that my statement (<code>SUBMISSION</code>) does not depend on? Ideally, I would like to import as few libraries from mathlib as possible, importing just enough for the statement to compile</li>
<li>Is there any way I can speed up the compilation time of my file, most of which (I think) is currently spent on importing stuff? I timed <code>lean Preloaded.lean</code> with a stopwatch and it took about 14s to compile and I would like to get it down to well under 12 seconds (the faster the better)</li>
<li>I noticed in <code>analysis/specific_limits.lean</code> from mathlib that <code>𝓝</code> is notation for <code>filter.nhds</code> but I can't seem to use it myself. I also noticed that this was declared as <code>local notation</code> for <code>topological_space</code> (whatever that means). In the meantime, my workaround was to (re-)declare this notation myself to use it in my statement. Is there a way to avoid this workaround, or would you recommend that I just type <code>nhds</code> explicitly in my statement?</li>
<li>My formalization of the statement <code>0.999... = 1</code> seems rather clumsy to me - is there any way I could state it more cleanly (whatever that may mean)?</li>
</ul>

<p>You could also use <code>(∑ i:ℕ, 9 / 10 * (1 / 10) ^ i) = 1</code> which looks nicer but doesn't exactly assert that the sum is convergent (although if it's not convergent you almost certainly wouldn't be able to prove the equality)</p>

<p>So is your first example a more faithful rendering of <code>0.999... = 1</code>, or does it not really matter?</p>

<p>oh, well actually it is defined to return 0 on nonconvergent sums, so that is actually provably equivalent in this case</p>

<p>It's fine as long as it correctly states (something logically equivalent to) <code>0.999... = 1</code></p>

<p>for example a newbie knows that the sum f + g is the sum of f plus the sum of g, but they are not ready to prove that themselves</p>

<p>if you give them an undergraduate level definition of the limit, they can probably work with it but that's a separate exercise</p>

<p>If I intend to post the <code>0.999...</code> exercise as a way for beginners to practice with the concept of a limit (as taught at the undergraduate level), would it be fine to (re-)define the concept in the exercise instead of using the more general definition from mathlib?</p>

<p>teaching material often uses redefinitions, in particular because it makes it easier to prevent students from accidentally or otherwise reusing lemmas from the library that they are supposed to be proving, but this stuff generally doesn't feed back to mathlib</p>

<p>Got it. So basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>For teaching elementary concepts, redefining stuff already in mathlib is acceptable (and sometimes encouraged)</li>
<li>For the development of mathlib itself, definitely use as many existing definitions as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>BTW, <code>SUBMISSION</code> easily follows from <code>has_sum_geometric</code> and <code>has_sum_mul_left</code>.</p>
