<p>I've been working with <code>polynomial.lean</code>. I would like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mul_X_pow_eq_zero :

</pre></div>


<p>but I can't see it and it's not so clear to me how to get it from the interface. I am tempted to get my hands dirty and prove <code>(f * X ^ n) (m) = f (n + m)</code> [i.e. break the illusion and start treating polynomials as functions from nat to alpha] from which it follows relatively simply, but I suspect this would involve wading into finsupp. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> or anyone else -- am I missing a trick here?</p>

<p>I just generalized <code>leading_coeff_X_pow</code> to a <code>comm_semiring</code> which should help with the lemma about <code>leading_coeff (f * X ^ n)</code>.</p>

#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Sep 09 2018 at 12:44)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/f%2AX%5En%3D0%20-%3E%20f%3D0/near/133604218):
<p>I'd love to be proved wrong, but I don't think this is the right direction. The problem I have is not with <code>leading_coeff_X_pow</code>, it's with <code>leading_coeff_mul</code> and friends. The <code>mul</code> version needs an integral domain so I can't use it (I need a result over a general <code>comm_ring</code>). The <code>mul'</code> version cannot say "if the leading coefficients of <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> are non-zero then the leading coefficient of <code>fg</code> is the product" because this is not true (if the product of the leading coefficients is zero then there's a problem), so it says "if the leading coefficient of <code>f*g</code> is non-zero then...". Because the leading coefficient of a polynomial is non-zero iff the polynomial is non-zero I need <em>exactly</em> that if <code>f</code> is non-zero then <code>f*X^n</code> is non-zero to apply this lemma. This was what led me to the question in the title. My instinct is that one should prove this by hand. I can't seem to find <code>coefficient f d</code>, the coefficient of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>X</mi><mi>d</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X^d</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.849108em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.849108em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.849108em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">d</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span>. Of course it's just <code>f d</code> but I think it needs some notation because it's a fundamental concept. With this notion (which I could PR no problem) we have <code>f = 0</code> iff all its coefficients are zero (no problem), and then what I want is <code>coefficient (f * X) (d + 1) = coefficient f d</code>, for which I am going to have to go beyond the interface and into the definition of multiplication of polynomials, and I guess this is the explict lemma that I am asking for advice on. Once I have this I I think I can do everything else.</p>

<p>For <code>leading_coeff (f * X ^ n)</code> I would case on whether <code>f = 0</code>, if <code>f = 0</code> it's trivial, otherwise it's <code>leading_coeff_mul'</code> and you have to prove that <code>leading_coeff f * 1 != 0</code> which is easy because <code>f != 0</code> and <code>leading_coeff f = 0 iff f = 0</code></p>

<p>That relation <code>coefficient (f * X) (d + 1) = coefficient f d</code> seems basic and useful enough that it should be provided as a lemma in any case.</p>

<p>Johannes was talking about some way of representing polynomial as <code>C a + X * (C b + X * (...))</code>, which might give some more general strategies for dealing with this, because I do agree it is annoying at the moment.</p>

<p>It might just be a case of people getting stuck and proving millions of lemmas that I didn't think of like <code>(f * X) (d + 1) = f d</code> until the interface is good.</p>

<p>So Kenny has proved the result in perhaps the "correct" way. But I am confused about these things more generally. I talked to Chris about these things today and he cannot see the point of adding <code>def : coeff f n := f n</code> because "it is there already". I don't like <code>f n</code> at all for the coefficient of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>X</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.664392em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> because it looks misleading (it looks like evaluation) and ultimately people will need theorems such as <code>coeff (f * X ^ n) (i + n) = coeff f i</code>. Now I guess one could argue that one could still put such theorems in and give them appropriate names, but just write them as <code>(f * X ^ n) (i + n) = f i</code>. I do trust Chris in general but on the other hand I feel like making a good interface is important. Does anyone have any input on this? I feel it's a bit like making <code>set X = X -&gt; Prop</code> and then arguing that you don't need <code>mem</code> because "it is there already".</p>

<p>I agree that it is part of my "mental" interface to polynomials. After all "polynomials" are just some gadgets that float around. They aren't functions on <code>nat</code>. But you can somehow access their coefficients.</p>

<p>I'm okay with using <code>f x</code> for evaluation instead of coefficient extraction, but in my experience <code>eval</code> is less useful than I would have expected. Usually you actually need <code>eval2</code> since the polynomial actually lives in a different scalar ring than the one you are evaluating into</p>

<p>That's a good point. In practice there will be a canonical ring hom floating around that you want to plug into <code>eval2</code>. But I guess this is hard to put into Lean.</p>

<p>why is this slower than the previous one?</p>

<p>the answer is "try it and find out"</p>

<p>there are particular things that can happen that can cause a slowdown, but I don't know if I can account for each millisecond</p>

<p>ok seriously it can be as fast as 300 ms as long as I use <code>rw</code> instead of <code>refine</code>/<code>exact</code></p>

<p>I would guess the <code>(if_pos rfl).trans</code> spots are hard for the elaborator</p>

<p>I don't care about the coercion to fun, I'm just concerned that we don't have a good interface for coefficients. Is there a problem with adding <code>coeff f n</code> and using it to state lemmas and making it the "official" interface to access coefficients?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My only real opinion here is there should be exactly one way to write "the nth coefficient of f", so if we add <code>coeff</code> (which seems <span class="emoji emoji-1f44d" title="+1">:+1:</span>) then we should remove or change the coercion to fun instance.</p>

<p>There are two ways to write "x is an element of the set S" (which has never caused me any problems). Oh, and two ways to write "the integer corresponding to this natural number" (which has).</p>
