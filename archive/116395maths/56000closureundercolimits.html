<p>Suppose C is a <code>category.{u v}</code> that <code>has_colimits</code> and I have a family A_i of objects of C indexed by a <code>Type v</code>. I also have (let's say for simplicity) a fixed J which is a <code>small_category.{v}</code>. I want to construct the closure of the objects A_i under colimits of shape J, as a new family also indexed on a <code>Type v</code>. Is it possible?</p>

<p>I was going to use an inductive type of course, but in order to write down the data needed in the inductive constructor, I also need to know what the actual objects in C are (that is, the values of the indexed family), because a diagram involves morphisms in C between those objects. So I end up with an inductive-recursive definition.</p>

<p>I thought about adding the value of the object as an index of the type, but then it won't live in the right universe.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is to do some manual transfinite recursion up to an ordinal of large enough cofinality (I know... that's my solution to everything).</p>
