<p>I mentioned a link to a talk of Scholze on condensed sets recently. He's giving a course on it now:</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Condensed.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Condensed.pdf">a direct link to the pdf notes</a>. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> if you want to find a use for your categories other than "doing schemes properly" -- can you do this? This all looks very very reasonable to do in Lean, and it is a Fields Medallist explaining some completely up to the minute ideas. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> can you make anything of this? Scholze is wresting with some very general ideas about how mathematicians put topology in their work, but of course he is coming from a very algebraic perspective. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span> after exams do you want to take a look at this? This might be a big thing, and in stark contrast to the perfectoid space theory, the entireity of what is known to humanity about condensed mathematics is in those 33 pages. Seems like a great time to start formalising it!</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Theorem 1.10. The category of condensed abelian groups is an abelian category which satis-
fies Grothendieck’s axioms (AB3), (AB4), (AB5), (AB6), (AB3*) and (AB4*), to wit: all limits
(AB3*) and colimits (AB3) exist, arbitrary products (AB4*), arbitrary direct sums (AB4) and fil-
tered colimits (AB5) are exact,...
</pre></div>


<p>The proof looks simple. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> how far are we from formalising this stuff in Lean?</p>

<p>Tom and I were actually discussing this as a possible project last week. I guess it depends on the API for sheaves on sites. Do we have a definition of what it means for a Grothendieck topology to be generated by covering families, and can we work with sheaves on sites other than the opens of a topological space? Do we have the category of pro-objects of finsets, or at least Stone spaces? If that's all there, then the various categories of condensed (insert models of algebraic theory) should be straightforward to define.</p>

<p>I know that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> was thinking about Grothendieck topologies at some point but he ran into problems. Johan -- why did you stop doing sheaves on sites? Would working in one fixed universe help matters? Note that Scholze spends half his life justifying how he can do everything in <code>Type 0</code>.</p>

<p>A condensed X is a functor from the cat of profinite sets to the cat of X's. This is all coming out of Scholze's pro-etale stuff but it's independent of that.</p>

<p>One of the insights is that we always used to think about the etale site, but never the pro-etale site; this was only discovered a few years ago.</p>

<p>I stopped doing sheaves because I wasn't getting anywhere, and I wanted to move on with the perfectoid project. I would love to return to sites and topoi. Especially if there are more people who want to contribute!</p>

<p>Note that the first 5 pages out of 33 don't contain any maths. Otoh... lecturing has just started in Germany... so you can expect that from this week onwards this document will grow with 25 pages a week, until mid-July. (In particular, I don't think the statement "all that is known about condensed mathematics is written in these 33 pages" is correct. There are likely stacks of notes by Dustin and Peter lying around in there offices. And those will be appended to these lecture notes at high speed.)</p>

<p>I believe that both <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> and I have similar feelings about category theory -- at a basic level it offers little more than a collection of organising principles, and so far in mathlib we have managed to formalise many of those basic organising principles just fine without having to bundle everything -- see Galois connections etc. However, beyond a certain point the language does become a lot more useful and powerful, when the stuff you're organising starts getting out of hand. We are on the verge of this in mathlib -- we don't have sheaf cohomology yet but I could imagine defining it as a derived functor, for example. But because it's not been essential for anything else just yet, it is still there being rather uncared for with only Scott and Reid ever contributing to it. I have proposed rewriting parts of the schemes project using this language, and I would still very much like to do this. But this much meatier project of condensed mathematics might be a way of understanding much better which parts of the library need developing. How much of the basic category theory material needed before we can even contemplate a basic API for sites is already in mathlib and how much is just languishing elsewhere, about ten PR's away? That's a key question right now.</p>

<p>I would be curious to see what a "plain formalization" of infinity categories looks like. HoTT is more of a "synthetic" formulation, a.k.a a shallow embedding, where you can't see outside the theory and so principles like univalence can be stated unqualified as axioms</p>

<p>In lean 3, unlike lean 2, you can't "turn off Prop", which is inconsistent with HoTT, so instead you have to carefully examine every def to make sure it doesn't use anything bad</p>

<p>Did he prove anything concrete which wasn't known already, or did he somehow just categorify known results? Do you understand anything about his work on the Tamagawa number problem Johan? Does one need category theory to prove it?</p>

<p>He proved the Tamagawa number conjecture for function fields, right? If he did it using infinity categories in an "essential" way (i.e. stripping them out would cause genuine pain) then that would be interesting. I simply have no idea how he did it. I went to a lecture by him about it all and it was 55 minutes history of the problem and then 5 minutes "oh by the way I finished the job"</p>

<p>It's impossible to rule out some trivial proof of FLT in PA although it would be the biggest shock to happen in pure mathematics for centuries were an elementary proof to be found.

<p>We have elaborate methods and conjectures, which ultimately yielded a proof of FLT, but 25 years later we are not really any closer to seeing on a more elementary level why it is true. It's a consequence of the Langlands philosophy, by deep work of Ribet and an observation of Frey-Hellgouarch.</p>

<p>but I am not sure I even care. I can take the total ring of fractions and then just demand that for all Weierstrass models there's some N such that the field of fractions of the Weierstrass model over Q embeds into this total ring of fractions.</p>

<p>Re: higher categories. I believe there is a formalization in progress to do semantics of HoTT. Maybe they formalized higher or infinity categories there, although I cannot find the repository now. <br>
On the other hand, often when doing categorical semantics of (homotopy) type theory, you don't directly work with infinity-categories, but instead you work with a model category (or similar), which is just a 1-category with some extra data. You can construct an infinity-category out of this data, but in practice it's easier to work with the 1-categorical formulation (for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>Floris, you must understand Kevin is overexcited by the completion of the perfectoid project, and dreaming out loud. There is no way we can formalize condensed mathematics when the category theory part of mathlib is not usable to define schemes.</p>

<p>they take hypersheaves (whatever that means) on compact hausdorff spaces instead of just Stone spaces (with the same type of Grothendieck topology, I believe)</p>
<p>interestingly, in 0.3 of the introduction, the authors point out that their theory actually requires an inaccessible cardinal while the theory of condensed objects can be developed in ZFC</p>
<p>also all the careful bookkeeping of universe-levels for sheaves and the word "tiny" (which I think is their terminology for <code>_ : Type 0</code>) is something that we're already used to dealing with in the category theory library</p>

<p>I've been thinking about this with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132603">@Calle Sönne</span> . I think that this stuff represents a really good way to see the category theory stuff in action. For a start it forces you to think about sites. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> suggested following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_topology#Axioms" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_topology#Axioms">this approach</a> for sites; then we need profinite sets, extremely disconnected sets and some basic theorems relating them -- do we have Stone-Cech compactifications? They would be really fun to do. Proving that the categories of sheaves on the three sites are equivalent (props 2.3 and 2.7 of <a href="https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Condensed.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Condensed.pdf">Scholze's notes</a> ) would be a great exercise, the maths proofs are relatively simple. Did anyone do sites in Coq or any of the other systems yet? Then proving Theorem 2.2 of those notes would be some flagship result.</p>

<p>If you imagine what we teach our 1st years, they certainly know that a power series is differentiable within its radius of convergence.</p>
