<p>I put a lot of work in splitting the uniform space + topological structure + completions mess, in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/uniform_split" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/uniform_split">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/uniform_split</a> But I'm stuck in type class hell. After two suspicious fix in exponential.lean and operator_norm.lean, I'm stuck again in bounded_continuous_map.lean. Clearly there is something wrong, and I can't find what. Help would be very much appreciated <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes Hölzl</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="210574">@Patrick Massot</span> I think a problem is the <code>has_coe α (completion α) </code> instance for uniform space completions. At last comparing the type class searches for the old and new version it looks like it diverges at this point.</p>
<p>I don't know how the completion mechanism works exactly. But we have transitivity rules. Maybe this means the type class mechanism will try to find a compitions of <code>α -&gt; (completion α) -&gt; (completion (completion α) ) -&gt; ...</code>. I think we need to remove this completion. I guess we should remove this coercion.</p>

<p>Patrick -- are you sure you even want a coercion? Kenny had a coercion from R to R[1/S] and IIRC did not even name the function, and all that happened was that Johan and I got frustrated that this completely fundamental map did not have a name. We both seemed very happy to apply the map explicitly when we needed it.</p>

<p>It looks like <code>has_coe_t</code> is not enough. I think it is only activated once, but then the type class search explodes. I'm in favor of removing this coercion.</p>

<p>Anyway, I intend to redo this completion stuff from scratch, following Bourbaki. So we can keep the coercion for now, and I'll try to avoid it when I'll do the Bourbaki completion</p>

<p>With the current construction, it's complicated to do the Hausdorff completion in two stages : first get something separated and then complete. Because the current construction quotients the space of <em>all</em> Cauchy filters to make it separated. If you start with something separated and take the space of <em>all</em> Cauchy filters then you loose separation, and you still need to quotient. So the map you get is a composition of three maps instead of two.</p>

<p>This is crucial for ring completion because extending the multiplication requires to first get a separated ring</p>

<p>I don't know where Johannes got this idea, but what Bourbaki does is to consider the space of <em>minimal</em> Cauchy filters. This way you get a complete Hausdorff space in one shot. I don't intend to delete the separate construction of the uniform structure on the space of all Cauchy filters, but it wouldn't be used in the construction of the Hausdorff completion anymore</p>

<p>OK, I understand this would certainly be more elegant and more efficient. But haven't all the desired properties already been established in the current framework? I mean, once the construction is done, one just needs to use the API and one can forget about the construction -- unless you want some things to be defeq while they are not currently, maybe?</p>

<p>One important point is to understand that the subcategory of complete (but not necessarily separated) uniform space is <em>not</em> a nice subcategory. Because you cannot extend by uniform continuity if the target space is not separated</p>

<p>Anyway, I think this reorganization was needed even without redoing completions. I hope it's ready for merge now. It's really painful to do this kind of work, but I hope it will pay in the long run</p>

<p>So you will have in any case to prove the first step: go from the nonseparated case to the separated one. For the second step, you could either use the elegant approach of Bourbaki, or use the current formalization, right?</p>

<p>In all cases type theory will never let use have definitional equality between the two steps process and the one step process</p>

<p>Now I am completely confused. Aren't <code>hcompletion</code> and <code>completion</code> canonically isomorphic, but not defeq?</p>

<p>Then you could pull the ring structure from <code>hcompletion</code> to <code>completion</code>, and say that if <code>\alpha</code> is a topological ring then <code>completion \alpha</code> is a topological ring, and this gives you an API with only one step, not mentioning <code>hcompletion</code> at all?</p>

<p>This is exactly the strategy that made me think we need to be able to pull back topological ring structures under uniform space isomorphisms. But, for some reason, this seems to be a non-trivial operation in type theory. So doing the direct construction (following Bourbaki) seems simpler</p>

<p>I can already do everything as in my old <code>completions_reloaded</code> branch. I'm trying to do it better</p>

<p>If you're convinced it will be better in the end, go ahead, but you have not really convinced me for now that you will really be saving energy in this way, instead of pulling back multiplication from <code>hcompletion</code> and checking the continuity (this is the only thing you have to pull back, right, everything else is already there?). This is probably because I don't know the gory details, of which you are certainly much more aware than me!</p>

<p>We'll see. It will probably depend how much I need to fight to get a nice space of minimal Cauchy filters. I'm not there yet. Even after merging this, I plan to first propose a bunch of modification to <code>uniform_space.basic</code> (I didn't want to mix reorganization and actual changes in the same PR)</p>
