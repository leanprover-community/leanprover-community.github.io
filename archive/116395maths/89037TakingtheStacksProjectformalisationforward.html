<p>I formalised the definition of a scheme -- in theory at least. I proved that an affine scheme was a scheme which gave me some sort of hope that I'd formalised the definition correctly. The files are a mess, some people were never happy with the names of the theorems or the names of the lean files, the whole thing needs a tidy. I have a Masters student who <em>might</em> be interested. What are the priorities here? He'd like to prove some more lemmas about schemes (and indeed we as a department would like to see some original material). But maybe I could use this as impetus to tidy the whole thing up. Does anyone have any ideas about what could be priorities here? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> you probably both have clearer ideas than me about where this project should be going.</p>

<p>A big question here is what to do with the sheaf theory. I defined a sheaf of rings and a presheaf of sets and a sheaf of sets on a basis of a topological space and blah blah blah; do we just sit and wait for more category theory stuff or use the fact that everything is a typeclass so the low-level approach is fine? How long will it be before mathlib contains all the machinery necessary to write "let F be a presheaf of rings on the topological space X" in a category-theory-like manner, so I don't have to also define morphisms of presheaves?</p>

<p>Right. I think those presheaves are pretty close. As soon as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span>'s coauthors stop being grumpy, we will get <code>backwards_reasoning</code> and then all sorts of limits. After that a bunch of stuff about sheaves will be within reach.</p>

<p>I managed just fine in the schemes project with no category theory. Part of me is scared that using the category theory stuff will actually make things more complicated! And unfortunately I must be completely honest and say that I have not been paying careful attention to exactly what is there and what is not there. I know that Scott's work seems to rely on a bunch of automation and I know that these things are very complicated to get right and that I know essentially nothing which would help. I would like to contribute to Scott's work by actually trying it out in some basic cases and then asking for advice when I can't get it to work.</p>
<p>Perhaps going back to the stacks project and doing it all again using the category-theoretic tools that we either have already or will have soon would be a good test case for this category theory stuff. I think that in particular getting the parts of category theory working which are used widely outside of pure category theory would be an important project.</p>

<p>Golly so we need backwards reasoning and then limits and _then_ sheaves? Because the sheaf axiom says that some map to a limit is an isomorphism?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> I think we should certainly try to take advantage of category theory. After all, we want étale cohomology next, and then you don't want to have live in a parallel universe where you have no category theory available...</p>

<p>I'm listening. :-) I've tried once or twice to just make my code on limits not need backwards_reasoning, but it felt pretty painful to me. <code>backwards_reasoning</code> \ <code>back</code> is actually quite close. Simon has ideas to make it efficient, but hopefully an inefficient PR can make it into mathlib if there's a promise we know how to make it fast, later.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span>, if the many different shapes of limit are causing some difficulty, I know that I would find it already very helpful to have just general (co)limits. Perhaps it would even be possible to do a version of these before <code>back</code> is merged (I might take another shot at this in a couple of days--I tried to set up a branch with all the limit types but it turned into too much work).</p>

<p>Could <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> or someone explain why limits are difficult to formalize or require <code>back</code>?

<p>I want to define a locally ringed space in Lean (or rather get a student to define it). So this is a topological space plus a sheaf of rings plus an axiom about some direct limits (see <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01HA" target="_blank" title="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01HA">stacks project</a> for more info). I don't see that we have to wait for categories for this to happen. But when categories arrive, will this work somehow be wasted? I am assuming not. I didn't ever define a locally ringed space in the schemes repo, I dodged it, but I think I want to do things more properly this time.</p>

<p>There is an oper PR which includes equalizers and products and another WIP one which constructs them for rings, so then you can define sheaves in that language. Johan seemed interested in defining sites for the perfectoid space project, and that seems like a reasonably small amount of effort to "future-proof" sheaves for the zariski topology</p>

<p>So what does the definition of a locally ringed space look like now? It's going to be a structure consisting of a topological space, and then a presheaf of rings -- but I shouldn't define this by hand myself now? And then some lemma about a direct limit being local.</p>

<p>I think that when I was trying to write the code last Feb I would just keep saying "look these things are a category" without ever really thinking about what advantage this would actually give me. Here's a concrete question. A locally ringed space is a topological space, a functor from the category of open sets to the category of rings, an axiom about this functor (a statement about the values of the functor on open covers of open sets -- some kernel equals some image) and another axiom about this functor (about direct limits of rings which are values of the functor being local rings). I can write all of that without ever mentioning categories, but the language (functors, direct limits) is everywhere. I am still unclear about what the modern way to define this structure is (independent of my usual confusion about what should be bundled).</p>

<p>So to do locally ringed spaces we need that stalks are local, so we need colimits in the category of commutative rings. If we were doing this in a category free way then I'd know what to do. How does this all work within the category theory framework? This would be a colimit over the set of all open sets containing a fixed point <code>a</code> in a topological space <code>X</code>.</p>

<p>I assume you also want a specific explicit description of the stalk. So under the current/near future state of category theory in mathlib, I would suggest just doing the "category-free" construction, and then if it seems useful or interesting, also show that what you built is actually a colimit, i.e., fits in a cocone with the expected universal property.</p>

<p>I guess proving that the stalk is a colimit should help you prove that a morphism of ringed spaces does induce maps on stalks, for example.</p>

<p>Then, I would suggest building the indexing category for the colimit "opens containing <code>x</code>" by hand, or possibly using <code>full_subcategory</code>, and check that its opposite category is filtered, and then define <code>stalk x F</code> as the <code>directed_colimit_of_rings</code> of <code>F</code> composed with the inclusion of "opens containing <code>x</code>" in <code>opens X</code></p>

<p>Should it be <code>H : scheme S</code> or <code>S : scheme</code>? In CS language I think this is asking whether schemes should be bundled or unbundled.</p>
<p>Any seasoned algebraic geometer will tell you that whilst the set underlying a scheme is of key technical importance, it does not play a completely central role, unlike the set underlying a group. For example, the set underlying a scheme has a topology on it, but the topology is grotesque -- on an irreducible scheme every non-empty open set is dense, there are typically many non-closed points and so on. One essentially never uses standard useful results from topology on this topological space, a standard way to prove things about schemes is to reduce them to questions about commutative rings and then do some commutative ring theory.</p>
<p>To give another example -- the category of schemes has products, but the underlying set of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S\times T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.76666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span></span></span></span> is essentially never the product of the underlying sets of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span></span></span></span>. So the kind of typeclass inference instances one sees for products of groups (<code>group G</code> and <code>group H</code> to <code>group (G x H)</code> ) is not correct for schemes.</p>
<p>Is this evidence that schemes should be bundled? I hope I got this the right way round -- I mean put the underlying topological space as a carrier and just have a structure called <code>scheme</code>? Or is the bundle/unbundle issue about other things?</p>
<p>We don't have much bundled stuff in mathlib. My naive understanding of what Cyril and Assia were telling us in Amsterdam was that perhaps if we did then we would begin to understand the power of unification hints. I am still very unclear about the general arguments for and against bundling, my impression is that when I ask a question of this nature the answer is often "try both and see which works best". But if we are to move forward with categories we'd better get the hang of bundling, right?</p>

<p>The underlying set of a scheme is basically never going to have any interesting kind of structure other than that which comes from being a scheme (this is related to the underlying set not commuting with products, so that the underlying set of a group scheme is not a group, etc.)</p>

<p>You can give <code>scheme</code> a <code>has_coe_to_sort</code> instance and write an instance for <code>(S : scheme) : topological_space S</code> so that you can still write <code>p : S</code>, <code>is_open U</code> where <code>U : set S</code>, etc.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> Perhaps this is the place for the discussion about using categories. I discouraged Ramon from using them because this is an MSc project with a hard deadline so we couldn't afford to be waiting for PRs or becoming involved in technical design implementation decisions -- we needed everything to be done by around now. However if we forget about this and start taking the longer view then in principle I think it's natural to want to use the category theory language going forward.</p>

<p>One reason I am beginning to think that this approach has its advantages is that as you know I've had questions over the last few days of the form "does Leave know that the category of topological rings has  limits?" If there was a topological ring category then I could just check the predicate and see where it leads me</p>

<p>There does not need to be a proliferation of <code>equiv</code>s, and one can do (pre)sheaves of Xs for all Xs at once without any effort. Both are already problems in this definition of schemes.</p>

<p>I think the right way forward here is to start PRing all the zariski topology and localisation related stuff into mathlib, and as soon as general presheaves land in mathlib someone can start refactoring the (relatively small part) of the schemes code to use that style.</p>

<p>Hi, sorry I didn't reply on the other thread. I won't be able to do much in the following month or so as I have exams. However, I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> that in order to eventually have schemes in the mathlib we need to use <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/886" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/886">#886</a> and related. Since there are still a few pieces missing and I have to submit everything in two months, I don't think it's a good idea for me to start refactoring sheaves but I quite like the idea of PRing everything else and making the schemes repository as small as possible.</p>

<p>OK so over the last day or two I had a good look at what Ramon has done. One reason I did this was that we need sheaves for the perfectoid project, and I really wanted to use categories, but I find it very hard to make them work because of (a) universe issues (b) the fact that much of the relevant stuff is not yet in mathlib (which breaks update-mathlib which breaks my workflow). Talking about this to Johan (who has had more experience using the category theory repo than me) he says that I'm trying to use it too quickly, and getting a solid API is even more crucial than when using non-category theory Lean.  </p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that I shouldn't be running before I can walk. So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> here is my current proposal. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132858">@Ramon Fernandez Mir</span> has made what looks to me like a very solid repo</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ramonfmir/lean-scheme" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/ramonfmir/lean-scheme">https://github.com/ramonfmir/lean-scheme</a></p>
<p>where he defines schemes and locally ringed spaces, and proves that an affine scheme is a scheme. He did not use category theory stuff at all. The code is an order of magnitude better than the code that Chris Kenny and I wrote when we were beginners. Most or all of my poor design decisions have been fixed. A crucial role is played by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130308">@Neil Strickland</span> 's localisation predicate (which Ramon has now turned into a proper API, because he has had to use it extensively in the code). </p>
<p>The "next" results in the development of schemes are: to define a morphism of locally ringed spaces, and to prove that Spec: comm_ring -&gt; locally ringed spaces and Gamma: locally ringed spaces -&gt; comm_ring are adjoint functors. I am confident that Ramon's code will be good enough to make a non-category-theory proof of this. But the very statement of this is more naturally expressed in category theory language.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that a <em>better</em> test than the perfectoid repo, for seeing if categories are, or could be, made usable in Lean in the future (and I am optimistic that they can be), is to see if we can do some or all of the following things:</p>
<p>1) prove the Gamma-Spec adjunction within the language of category theory, in Lean.</p>
<p>2) replace Ramon's "hand-coded" sheaves of types and rings with category sheaves of types and rings</p>
<p>3) replace Ramon's "sheaf on a basis" with a category-theoretical approach</p>
<p>This to me looks like a substantial task. However what I am <em>hoping</em> is that actually rather than having to completely refactor the repo, we can actually incrementally build upon it, replacing definitions one by one. Doing this will show us actually whether things like total code length is going down or up when the category theory language is used. </p>
<p>I am wondering whether the fact that the code is already there in non-categorified form will somehow make experiments here easier than having to develop the theory from first principles. This is what my interpretation of Johan's API comment is. Johan -- if we have made all the definitions and proved all the theorems already, how easy will it be to make new definitions and prove new theorems using the category theory language? I think this will be a good test for the category theory stuff.</p>
<p>I am in no hurry to do this project, and Ramon now has to worry about other things such as passing his exams and writing up a pdf document about his project. But it seems to me to be a good practical application of all this category theory language and it might shed some light on things like design decisions. For example it occurred to me when trying to use categories within perfectoids that I really had lost all sight of the reason that I was trying to be maximally universe polymorphic. I had objects living in universe u and morphism sets Hom(X,Y) living in universe v. Why? I have no idea. All the other people using perfectoid spaces have objects living in Type and morphisms living in Type. Every example of a perfectoid space we will ever make, will live in Type, as far as I can see. At the very least Scott and I realised that perhaps we should have objects in <code>Obj : Type u+1</code> and morphisms in <code>Hom X Y : Type u</code> (have I got this the right way round?). These "large categories" (if I've got it right) might make universes more manageable. The way I have started to think about them is like this: imagine I'm doing this stuff in ZFC (which was the way I always used to think about them). Where do the objects live there? Now call the ZFC universe u and see what happens. In particular I am suggesting that, just like the way Lean defines the reals to be a term of type Type rather than Type u, we define "concrete" categories such as the category of perfectoid spaces or the category of locally ringed spaces to only have one free universe variable rather than two. Even the category of sheaves of rings on a topological space -- I am now arguing that the rings should be in the same universe as the topological space, because that's how it actually works in maths and for the categories that come up in regular maths this doesn't seem to be an issue. I wish I knew more about e.g. Lurie's work on (infinity,1) categories to know whether this will be an issue. Reid do you have any comments on this?</p>

<p>1) Prove that projective 1-space is a scheme. This would be our first non-affine scheme. Kenny -- this might be a neat project after exams. <br>
2) Completely rip out Ramon's sheaves code and replace it with Scott's category theory code. Scott -- let's make your code work as well as we can, to solve real world problems in pure maths formalization.</p>
<p>I finally understand now that we should be doing something like -- first figuring out how to host such a project, and then just running with our own branch of mathlib -- or fork, or whatever the terminology is.</p>

Has anyone ever defined schemes in Coq? If so, did they use category theory or not? Do we have anything to learn from any Coq experiences in these areas?</p>
<p>PS Does it matter in which order one tries (1) and (2)?</p>

<p>The goal would be to define the category of locally ringed spaces in a way which looked presentable to a mathematician.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132858">@Ramon Fernandez Mir</span> can you get your objects and morphisms all defined within <code>Type</code>?  I should just try it myself -- I'm compiling.</p>

<p>Hey, I still need to clean up the repository a bit to make it properly usable but should be ready soon. I still haven't looked into the potential universe issues we talked about. My impression is that they should be manageable. Is everything within one universe what we want?</p>
<p>Also, my ideal is to PR a fair amount of it to the mathlib, mainly the localization predicate and basic facts about Spec(R) (where should these go btw?).</p>
<p>Regarding the projective line, I'd really like to have it there before my deadline. We currently have two examples: the empty scheme :-))) and affine schemes. But I feel like three is a much nicer number. How hard do we think it'll be? Hopefully reasonably easy, right? I'd be happy to do it with you Kenny if it's something you'd be interested in.</p>

<p>I know for sure that in the category of ZFC locally ringed spaces, the objects are all topological spaces equipped with some extra structure and hence the objects of the ZFC category form a proper class, which is the ZFC version of <code>Obj : Type 1</code>. However for any two objects <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> of the category, <code>Mor X Y</code> has is a set, so <code>\Pi (X Y : Obj),Mor X Y : Type</code>.  I would be perfectly happy to make the category of locally ringed spaces in these restricted universe situations using either Scott's or Ramon's development. I have still not seen a convincing argument for why I as a pure mathematician should care about universes so I would like to push this until I do.</p>

Concerning stress tests: I think the Gamma-Spec adjunction should be at the top of the list. Once we have that one under our belt, I think that constructing P^n (via charts, or maybe via Proj) is a good second step. After that we should prove that P^n is proper over the base scheme. Once we have those, I think it is safe to say that "we can start doing algebraic geometry".</p>
