<p>Ok so after a ropey start (see my heq thread earlier) I made it through the <code>topological_space.lean</code> file today and wrote some docs on it: <a href="https://github.com/kbuzzard/mathlib/blob/docs-topspaces/docs/theories/topological_spaces.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/kbuzzard/mathlib/blob/docs-topspaces/docs/theories/topological_spaces.md">https://github.com/kbuzzard/mathlib/blob/docs-topspaces/docs/theories/topological_spaces.md</a> . I needed to read this file for my work on schemes -- in particular I had to finally understand what a filter was and what they had to do with topological spaces.</p>

<p>You are a bit unfair with filters. You should at least explain that they allow to cover uniformly the cases of sequences and maps from topological spaces. And then slightly more exotic stuff like one-sided limits at some real. That's why Bourbaki invented them.</p>

<p>One way to motivate them is to consider the ~16 variations on L'hopital's theorem that arise with lots of permutations of limits to different places in the domain and codomain</p>

<p>when I actually ploughed through the file and a lot of the imports, and set pp.all on occasionally etc etc and finally got to the bottom of things and discovered that F &lt;= G iff G subseteq F</p>

<p>The description of topological basis is also a bit grumpy; the point as I mentioned before is to say "a topological basis is a collection of sets satisfying these two axioms" and then fold in the connection to generating a topology</p>

<p>Mario, the reason I don't buy your explanation is that there is a standard definition of a basis of a topological space, which we all learn, and which is on Wikipedia, and which is not what is implemented, so all your protestations that it's a better way of doing it are cancelled out by the fact that every mathematician will be confused by the way it's done. I have flagged the relevant lemma which saves us.</p>

<p>A base is a collection B of subsets of X satisfying these two properties:<br>
1. The base elements cover X.<br>
2. Let B1, B2 be base elements and let I be their intersection. Then for each x in I, there is a base element B3 containing x and contained in I.</p>

<p>I think it still misses the main point of using filters: you have limits at a point and limits when a real variable or a natural number goes to infinity gathered in a single definition. For instance uniqueness of limit that you mention in your doc is proved for all three (and more) situations at once. This has nothing to do with "non-mathematical points such as running times".</p>

<p>I just don't know anything about how filters are used in practice so am in no position to be able to write those parts of the docs properly. I've never had to use them before and I don't really care about explaining them for this reason; I just wanted to get down the things I needed to know myself.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  just added your documentation, I guess we can add more comments on filters later.<br>
I think one problem why there is not a lot of knowledge about filters (or nets) in math, is that it is obvious and usually something you don't need to think about. But we are in a formal system, so we are either forced to generalize over limits (using filters or nets) or we produce a lot of duplication (as Mario and Patrick mentioned). We can avoid them and define things like <code>compact</code> using open covers etc. But some proofs get much more concise using the fact that you can use the complete lattice (and even category theory) properties properties of filters. Currently it is not always intuitive to work with filters, but maybe with more automation and better syntax notations and support from the parser it may get better.<br>
In the end they are a powerful abstraction, and as most abstractions it takes some time to learn it.</p>

<p>There is a very expressive way to use filters, with the word eventually.<br>
<code>def eventually {α : Type} (P : α → Prop) (f : filter α) := {x | P x} ∈ f.sets</code><br>
Then if you want to say that, eventually, some function u defined on nat is nonnegative, you write<br>
<code>eventually (λn, 0 ≤ u n) at_top</code><br>
If you want to say the same thing around a point x, say (which corresponds to a filter <code>at x</code>), you just write it as<br>
<code>eventually (λy, 0 ≤ f y) (at x)</code><br>
In this way, you can also write readable definitions of limits, or essentially whatever involves filters. This is the only way I use filters in Isabelle, and I was essentially never stuck.</p>

<p>I'm fine with adding this definition, especially with a corresponding quantifier notation (and also its dual the <code>frequently</code> quantifier). I'm just not sure if we should abandon the <code>f.sets</code> notation or keep both.</p>

<p>I want to refactor the filter stuff so that <code>.sets</code> is superfluous, i.e. <code>s \in f</code> means <code>s \in f.sets</code>. I guess we can support <code>eventually</code> if it's a <code>reducible</code> definition, but I don't like the idea of duplicating everything for this purpose</p>
