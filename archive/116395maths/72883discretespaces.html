<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes Hölzl</span> nice! This is something I was also considering adding, compare <a href="https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory/blob/lean-3.4.1/src/for_mathlib/analysis_topology_topological_space.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory/blob/lean-3.4.1/src/for_mathlib/analysis_topology_topological_space.lean">https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory/blob/lean-3.4.1/src/for_mathlib/analysis_topology_topological_space.lean</a>. I was thinking of making it an alternative branch in the <code>topological_space &lt;- uniform_space &lt;- metric_space</code> chain; in the link I put it on top of <code>topological_space</code> but it could easily go on top of <code>uniform_space</code> instead.<br>
Thoughts?</p>

<p>The advantage is that you wouldn't need all those separate instances for spaces like <code>nat</code>--the disadvantage is you have to be a bit careful to define the instances for things like products and sums correctly, I guess.</p>

<p>I wonder if there exists a case where we have a discrete topology, but one still additional topological structures on it. For example <code>orderable_topology</code> doesn't hold for all discrete spaces. Of course <code>orderable_topology</code> is a mixin in itself so it would fit. But I prefer the flexibility we get from mixins. And I guess <code>discrete_topology</code> isn't used too often so writing two parameters instead of one shouldn't be too hard.<br>
Hence, I would like to keep it as an mixin (i.e. a predicate, not containing the toplogical structure).</p>

<p>Ah, I see. I can imagine a situation where you have a manifold or a topological ring or something, and then also want to assume or prove that the topology is discrete. Makes sense.</p>
