<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> It seems that on a general site, sheafification needs localisation of categories and calculus of fractions. I would like to hear from you if you think it is realistic to work on this now, or is this to hard for now?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> I suppose those topics should be doable, but I wonder whether you really need them.<br>
I'm confused by the proof of Proposition 2.1 at <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheafification#existence" target="_blank" title="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheafification#existence">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheafification#existence</a>. It seems that we are done immediately after quoting "result 1", if all we care about is the existence of a sheafification functor.<br>
I suppose you also want to produce something resembling a formula for it?</p>

<p>Hmmm, I hope that it wouldn't matter how we prove the existence (by a construction, or indirectly) as long as we can provide an API. We will want the universal property (i.e. adjunction), the fact that sheafification is idempotent and that it preserves stalks.</p>

<p>OK, so the first two properties (which are essentially the same thing) are valid for the full subcategory of presheaves which are local with respect to <em>any</em> <strong>set</strong> of maps, not just one which comes from a coverage.</p>

<p>That fact is not so easy, but it's on my to-do list--it follows from the small object argument.</p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly what the third statement means, but it sounds potentially formal, in the right setup.</p>

<p>Ok, cool! I'm not surprised that localisations are not-so-easy. But I think it would be awesome if we could have them.<br>
For stalks: either you do this for points of a topos, and I would think it is then pretty formal (but maybe less intuitive for those not familiar with them, like me). Or you do it for stalks of points in a topological space, which is less general, and you would have to build more bridges. But large parts of it should be formal anyway, since stalks are by definition filtered colimits, and I hope those are preserved by the right sort of adjoint functor.</p>
