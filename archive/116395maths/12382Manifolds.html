<p>I have the definition of manifold over a normed field in Lean. You can see it in the following link<br>
<a href="https://github.com/truonghoangle/manifolds" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/truonghoangle/manifolds">https://github.com/truonghoangle/manifolds</a><br>
If you do not mind, please can you give me advice about it, special name of function or section and approach way to the definition of tangent bundle.</p>

<p>The current state of thingsI have done on manifolds is in <a href="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/basic.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/basic.lean">https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/basic.lean</a>. I am going for a more general approach, that would also encompass manifolds with boundaries, or manifolds with corners, or Thurston's (G,X) structures, but essentially the basic definitions are the same as yours, i.e., an atlas such that the changes of charts belong to some class of maps (called a groupoid, as in the fundamental textbook of Kobayashi and Nomizu). What I have done so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>extended the material on derivatives, to get access to a convenient API (PRed in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/966" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/966">#966</a>)</li>
<li>defined local equivalences, just like you do except I use genuine functions instead of pfuns, to avoid defining yet another notion of derivatives (and I don't care what the functions do outside of their domains and codomains), and defined a basic interface for them (in <a href="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/local_equiv.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/local_equiv.lean">https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/local_equiv.lean</a>). The fact that this is a good choice has been questioned by several people on Zulip, who encouraged me to use pfuns as you do, but for now it seems to go rather smoothly -- I need to develop the library further to see what the advantages and drawbacks are.</li>
<li>defined C^n functions, and proved basic properties (invariance under addition, composition, and so on), in <a href="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/times_cont_diff.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/times_cont_diff.lean">https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/times_cont_diff.lean</a></li>
<li>defined general manifolds based on groupoids. As well as diffeomorphisms (for the groupoid structure), and proved that the inverse or the composition of two diffeomorphisms is a diffeomorphism (this is not so obvious) in <a href="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/basic.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/basic.lean">https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/manifold4/src/geometry/manifolds/basic.lean</a>. Specialized to smooth manifolds, for which I am now defining the tangent space.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal would be to go up to the Whitney embedding theorem (any smooth real manifold embeds in R^N for large enough N), which is a non-trivial theorem, to stress-test the definitions and the interface.</p>

<p>One important point in library-building, I think, is that writing down definitions is not enough: you need to prove theorems, to see how definitions work out well or not, and what interface you need for the proofs. For instance, the first statement I settled to prove is that the composition of diffeomorphisms is a diffeomorphism. This showed me that I needed to implement a serious interface to local equivs, that now takes over 800 lines. And now defining the tangent space shows me gaps in this interface, that I will have to fill.</p>

<p>My goal would be to go up to the Hodge theorem. I also think that the definition is right through the proof of the theorems. For instance about tangent bundle, we have three ways to give the definition.  Moreover, for complex manifold, we have three tangent bundle.  I am struggling between approachable approach on complex, real number and general ways.</p>

<p>I am going for a general way (over any field), as follows: let <code>charts x</code> be the set of all charts around <code>x</code>. If <code>e</code> and <code>e'</code> are such charts, they yield a linear map from <code>E</code> to <code>E</code>, the derivative of <code>e' o e^{-1}</code>. Take the quotient of <code>(charts x) × E</code> under these identifications, this gives the tangent space. Hopefully, this should be easily generalizable to define exterior or symmetric products of the tangent bundle, opening the way to Riemannian metrics and to differential forms. But before doing the general case, I will stick to tangent spaces for now.</p>

<p>Another definition would be to choose one chart around each point, and only use this one to define the tangent space. This avoid taking a quotient, but it is less canonical. I will have to do it at some point, though, because I will want the derivative of a map to be a bounded linear map between tangent spaces, and for this I need a normed space structure on the tangent space, for which there is no canonical choice.</p>
