<p>In the perfectoid project, we have a 250 lines long file about <code>open_subgroups G</code>: the type of open subgroups of a topological group.<br>

<p>I want to PR this to mathlib. Should I triplicate this file to also provide <code>open_submonoids</code>, <code>open_subrings</code>? There will be all sorts of order preserving maps and galois insertions all over the place. Is that the right approach? Or do we need something a bit more meta?</p>

<p>I don't remember ever seeing a use for open submonoids that are not subgroups.  Open ideals come up all the time, but open subrings seem less common.</p>

<p>Ok, so maybe we should just PR this as is... and then later someone can pile open ideals on top of this.</p>

<p>I do wonder exactly what we needed from open ideals which didn't just come straight from open subgroups. I feel like this might be a bit like the units of a ring. I was surprised when I couldn't find units of a ring and then realised we had units of a monoid. Then I thought "yeah but I need things like units of a ring are a group" and then I realised that units of a monoid are a group.</p>

<p>We formalised open subgroups precisely because we needed open ideals</p>
