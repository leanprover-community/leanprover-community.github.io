<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115715">@Jason Rute</span> Great question! I would love for the community to continue discussing design issues in the formal encoding and to start (pseudo-)formalizing many historical problem statements. The main goal now is not to accumulate formal statements but to discover the conceptual challenges with the F2F formulation as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>I will soon push a description of a few of the design challenges to <a href="https://github.com/IMO-grand-challenge/formal-encoding" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/IMO-grand-challenge/formal-encoding">https://github.com/IMO-grand-challenge/formal-encoding</a></p>

<p>In response to the determine file: I was also thinking a bit about this exact problem how to translate these problems.<br>
The third proposal, using the solution set, is also not adequate. <code>determineSolutionSet X s_0</code> is equivalent to showing that <code>s_0</code> is countable: I can define (with a little bit of work) a <code>SolutionSet</code> witness using <code>choice</code> if I have proven that <code>s_0</code> is countable.</p>
<p>I think a reasonable (but not completely satisfactory) solution is to change all problems of the form "determine all <code>f</code> that satisfy <code>P f</code>" to "Show that for all <code>f</code> we have <code>P f</code> iff <code>f</code> is in an explicitly given solution set". Of course, this is unsatisfactory, since we're already "giving the answer" to the program. Though I think that everyone will agree that finding the answer is not the "hard part" of a problem.</p>
<p>Another possible option is that we do require the F2F programs to find the solutions themselves, but that the solution can only use certain specific "whitelisted" definitions from the library, and no other definitions. There might be issues in deciding which definitions are allowed so that we avoid all unsatisfactory answers.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span> Hi Floris, thanks for pointing out that <code>countablyInfinite</code> is not "sound", in that it permits unacceptable solutions using choice. I will add that to the document, and to remove any possibility of a similar issue, I will remove the entire clause in the tentative proposal that allows for specific solution formats to be accepted without inspection. As for the "whitelist", this would be great but I am skeptical that it will be possible. Do you find the tentative proposal to be a reasonable compromise?</p>

<p>In some sense this just shows that the IMO problem is badly specified... we have this issue with exams as well. If you ask a question like this in Germany, you will always have students who will prove this by the informal analogue of <code>\&lt;_, iff.refl _\&gt;</code>. And if you don't give them full points, they might even threaten to sue the university... things like this have really happened.</p>

<p>Floris, I don't think you can say "everyone will agree that finding the answer is not the "hard part" of a problem". Even the easy 2019 Q1 becomes much easier if you give the solution set.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="230999">@Daniel Selsam</span> I don't think the proposal is reasonable. Looking at IMO 2019-4, It is decidable to check whether a specific pair <code>(n,k)</code> is a solution, so I think the degenerate solution falls into the category "will get full score without inspection" (if I understand your proposal correctly).</p>
<p>Even finiteness is too weak. Suppose a program proves that if <code>(n,k)</code> is a solution to IMO 2019-4, then the inequality <code>n, k &lt; 10^(10^100)</code> holds. We can then apply the degenerate solution. A human solution like that will be rejected (you are not allowed to omit a finite but infeasible amount of work).</p>

<p>Ok, I agree that giving the answer does make the problem easier. It's a useful hint to determine what proof approaches are likely to work.</p>

<p>Oh sorry, you want to manually check all answers. <br>
That is a reasonable compromise. It will be an extra challenge to the solvers: they have to define the solution set in a human-understandable way (so not buried behind a ton of definitions).</p>

<p>I don't have a precise source, but I hear these stories now and then... the professors in my department are really careful nowadays with how they handle students, exams, and all that. I've been present at several "Klausureinsichten" (where students come to see their grade, and the corrected exam). It's completely absurd. Never seen anything like that before. But I guess the most juicy stories are actually folklore, and jucier than what used to be their source in distant past.</p>

<p>I was once personally faced with this: <a href="https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/fist-1986.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/fist-1986.pdf">https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/fist-1986.pdf</a> . Question 2 is "find the real number which is the supremum of this explicit non-empty bounded set". I realise I am a bit confused about how to formalise this. I feel like the real question is "give a finite sequence of buttons which one can press on a calculator, such that after you've pressed them, the answer is on the screen".</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> Thanks. I would put this approach  in the "whitelist" category. I am open to this kind of approach in principle but I fear that a fleshed out proposal would not only be complicated but would probably still be at risk of being either too forgiving or too restrictive or both.</p>

<p>If we do "inspection of results by humans" then we'll still have to engineer the tactics in such a way that they produce convincing results.</p>

<p>Once that is done, proving that the result is <code>calculatorable</code> for a some reasonable definition of <code>calculatorable</code> is of course trivial.</p>

<p>My Lean 4 expertise suggests this is meant to be Lean 4 code (I mean I see Camel case). Does it mean you actually use Lean 4? Is it already possible to so interactively (say with a VScode extension)? Or do you have to write the file and call Lean 4 on the command line?</p>

<p>It also seems <code>\lam x, formula(x)</code> got replaced with <code>\lam x =&gt; formula(x)</code>. I very much applaud moving away from the comma, because it was used for too many other things. Even if Lean didn't get confused, I did (-;</p>

<p>Now we only need to make <code>\mapsto</code> notation for <code>=&gt;</code> and it will almost read like mathematics <span aria-label="stuck out tongue wink" class="emoji emoji-1f61c" role="img" title="stuck out tongue wink">:stuck_out_tongue_wink:</span></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> Hi Patrick. Yes, I have been using Lean4 for my pseudo-formalizing (and also my actual programming), but it is not ready for proving theorems yet (there is not even a tactic framework).</p>

<p>FYI To get started, I put a few "help requested"s in <a href="https://github.com/IMO-grand-challenge/formal-encoding/blob/master/design/transition_systems.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/IMO-grand-challenge/formal-encoding/blob/master/design/transition_systems.lean">https://github.com/IMO-grand-challenge/formal-encoding/blob/master/design/transition_systems.lean</a> (though I will probably switch to using GitHub Issues with RFC in the name). The high-level strategy I suggest is for us to go problem-class by problem-class (with some degree of parallelism), trying to encode a range of problem statements within each class in a uniform way while taking note of outliers and being conscious not to over-fit the details of historical problems.</p>
