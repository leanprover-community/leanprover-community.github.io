#### [ Kevin Buzzard (Jan 11 2019 at 18:05)](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/179818-Lean%20Together%202019/topic/Slides%20for%20perfectoid%20talk/near/154930325):
<p>Patrick told me on Thursday that I should outline what a perfectoid space was. I wasn't at all sure what to say to a room containing computer scientists, but somehow whilst speaking to them and answering questions it became a bit clearer to me what I could say and what level to go for.</p>
<p>So here <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/perfectoid.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/perfectoid.pdf">http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/perfectoid.pdf</a> are the notes for my talk; they have the funny property that they were only written after the talk, but hopefully they capture the spirit of what is going on in perhaps a more coherent way than what I said off the top of my head on Thursday.</p>
