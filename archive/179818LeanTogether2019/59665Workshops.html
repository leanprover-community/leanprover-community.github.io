<p>Ursula Martin told me about a follow-up to the 2017 Newton Institute Big Proof workshop. It's at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in  Edinburgh.   "The meeting will run from mid-day on Monday 27th May 2019  to mid-day on Friday 31 May 2019, with a focus on computer-aided proof for mathematics, in particular pragmatic foundations, social processes, and exchange formats. " </p>
<p>I don't know if there's a web page yet.</p>

<p>There is a webpage: <a href="https://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/mathsomac/newton-icms-big-proof.html" target="_blank" title="https://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/mathsomac/newton-icms-big-proof.html">https://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/mathsomac/newton-icms-big-proof.html</a> - like most ICMS things the event is by invitation; many here will be invited already, and the "informal enquiries" will definitely be followed up on.  But there is a limited capacity for the space.</p>
