<p>Patrick,</p>
<p>What are you doing? FWIW, our aim isn't to teach Lean, per se, but to teach logic, proof, set theory, etc. Rather that a paper-pencil course using basic predicate logic and human checkers, we figured we'd teach them (they're early CS students) a more computational approach to logic, proof, checking, set theory (at least parts of it in Lean), etc. So it's Lean for teaching (discrete math), with teaching Lean as a necessary component.</p>

<p>Many of my early undergraduate students last semester (the first time we taught this) found it fairly rough going. One of the key points of friction is that students largely want to know how to get useful stuff done, and they don't see that learning DM using Lean, or that learning Lean, is going to help them in that regard. If they could just take a Javascript course, they'd be happy.</p>

<p>The advantage of the private streams is that many of my students have 1000+ unread messages in the main chat, which they ignore, but they keep up to date with the IC chat because it's typically at a lower level. Occasionally someone asks something smart and I say "ask that in the main chat".</p>

<p>I have been throwing out random exercises to mathematicians for a while, and one thing which sometimes goes down well is "let's make a new structure", e.g. let them import data.real.basic but nothing from data.complex, and then make the complex numbers from scratch and prove it's a field. This forces people to think about exactly what is needed. It's hard to start. You know that you want all the proofs to be "check on real and imaginary parts", but if you don't get the absolute basic stuff right then you're in trouble.</p>

<p>Something which is harder than you want it to be is basic examples of groups of small order. Amelia Livingstone was doing the 2nd year group theory example sheets and on the first sheet one question was "true or false: if G is abelian then G is cyclic". To answer this in Lean you have to explicitly produce a non-cyclic abelian group. There are lots of ways to proceed so this is a nice question. However you construct it, you've got to prove it's not cyclic though! This kind of question is interesting. For some people they might end up exasperated that something so trivial is hard to do in Lean, but on the other hand others might start thinking "what is an actual good way of rigorously proving C_2 x C_2 is not cyclic".</p>

<p>You might want to scan that 2nd year abstract algebra course and see if there is anything which is not in mathlib yet. One structured homework, once they know what they're doing, could be to get that stuff in.</p>

<p>Quotients are hard; you need to know your out from your mk from your lift from your sound from your computational principle, and these are not words which are particularly familiar to mathematicians. But if you show them how to make quotient groups I bet they can make quotient rings.</p>

<p>An exercise I found particularly nice when I was teaching my 1st year course last term was proving that there was an equiv between equivalence relations on a type and partitions of the type, where a partition is a set of disjoint non-empty subsets whose union was the type.

<p>At some point one has to think about the issue that there are some things which are really easy to do "in maths" but hard to do in Lean. I did not change my example sheet questions when I started integrating Lean into my teaching, but Patrick did.</p>

<p>One thing which was just as much fun in lean as in maths was basic questions about sups and infs. For example proving that if sup(S) = l then inf(-S)=-l, or if sup(S)=s and sup(T)=t then sup(S+T)=s+t. Those are a joy to do in Lean and should give satisfaction to beginners.</p>

<p>When I was a kid you could buy chicken mcnuggets in our local McDonalds in bags of 6 or 9, or a box of 20. I worked out the largest number that it was not possible to buy, and proved it in Lean. Proofs of this can go on for a very long time unless you know what you're doing.</p>

<p>Warning: nice little questions about number theory can be ferociously difficult for beginners, because subtraction is poorly behaved on nat, and passing between nat to int is hard.</p>

<p>This makes doing elementary number theory a lot harder than one might initially guess. I wrote <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/extras/casts.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/extras/casts.md">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/extras/casts.md</a> in an attempt to formalise some ideas of how to deal with this -- this is a long way from a mathematician's comfort zone. I lost count of the number of times I was asked last summer how to prove that a + b = c given the hypothesis that a + b = c, where there were random up-arrows in the hypothesis and/or the goal.</p>

<p>Proving that composite of injective functions is injective is easy, as is proving composite of surjective functions is surjective. But proving that a surjective function has a one-sided inverse is a nightmare if you don't know what you're doing; use <code>choose</code>!</p>

<p>Rolling your own limits of sequences and then proving that sum of limits is limit of sums, and product of limit is limit of products, is quite good fun.</p>
