<p>Does anyone know about any attempt to formalize in Lean graphs ? I am looking for results generally presented in a discrete math course</p>

<p>I don't think that many results from such a course have yet been formalized (though I'd love to be proven wrong). There are a few attempts you can find in Zulip if you search for "graph" or "graphs", e.g. <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Dependent.20induction.3F/near/178468919" title="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Dependent.20induction.3F/near/178468919">this recent thread</a>, <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Structure.20for.20simple.20graphs/near/176670030" title="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Structure.20for.20simple.20graphs/near/176670030">this slightly older one</a> and <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/a.20combinatorial.20challenge/near/157604832" title="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/a.20combinatorial.20challenge/near/157604832">this even older one</a>.

<p>This has come up before, and the general problem seems to be that there are ten different kinds of formalised things that are informally all called "graphs".</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> You mean "formalisable" not "formalised", right?</p>

<p>As in... there aren't 10 Lean files at the moment.</p>

<p>Yes. I mean simply that the edges may or may not be directed, multiple edges may be allowed and so on.</p>

<p>Yes <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> , many different ways. I am trying to find simple examples for my next course on discrete math. This semester I didn’t cover graphs</p>

<p>I have been asked to give a one day Lean workshop at a combinatorics conference for PhD students in April and I would be very interested in any work on formalising any kind of graph theory</p>
