<p>What is this huge white gap at the bottom of my proof? It's constantly there, and feels weird.</p>

<p>You really need some postprocessing of the state window. The most important is that displaying information on <code>refl</code> is very distracting. The line numbers refer to nothing meaningful to the player. Syntax highlighting is missing. The upper right switch is irrelevant.</p>

<p>When proving, the red squiggle under the last character which simply indicates the proof is not finished is very confusing.</p>

<p>Mohammad -- the undergraduates also have some feedback about this game. I have some notes in my office -- we should maybe meet on Monday. It's just about playable but we should make some minor changes before I start banging on about it on Twitter. In my mind one big question is whether we should make it all very beautiful -- but this is something that I am incapable of doing and which might take forever. Another big question is how this compares to the approach which <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="123965">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span> was taking using Observable. I know that Patrick feels like proving things about natural numbers is hellishly boring, but it's actually what we're teaching the undergraduates at Imperial right now so I thought it was worth pushing on with this.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of levels which aren't pushed. By the way, Mohammad's code which made the website from the Lean code is here <a href="https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker">https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker</a> and the Lean code which we used is here <a href="https://github.com/mpedramfar/natural_number_game" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/mpedramfar/natural_number_game">https://github.com/mpedramfar/natural_number_game</a> although I made some local modifications which I didn't push because I got confused about if I could fork his fork of my project :-)</p>

<p>Is there a link to a "live" version of the site that I'm missing or do we have to install it locally to try it out? I did actually experiment a bit with implementing some of the "natural number game" in Observable back when you first mentioned it but I didn't get much further than parsing some edited version of the comments into markdown (see <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/2398a546dac54a5d" target="_blank" title="https://observablehq.com/d/2398a546dac54a5d">here</a>, but there's really not much).</p>

<p>Yeah, sure. Monday's fine. I'm not an expert on Observable so I'm not sure, but it seems to me that it's ideal for when you want people to be able to play around with "everything" in the page, including the javascript. If I understand it correctly, whether it's a website or observable, the codes to make it more beautiful and shiny must be written and are almost the same codes, but Observable might limit how much we will be able to control the design. I'm not sure though.</p>

<p>There are indeed some style limitations for Observable notebooks hosted on the observablehq site. However, it's possible to host notebooks on your own without those restrictions. There's probably not a big advantage to redoing all your work in a notebook if you've already gotten things to work well with the <code>lean-web-editor</code> project though.</p>

<p>I can't really give an unbiased answer to this. I did try to make it easier to do some things, like embed a bunch of different Lean editors into a document and pass data between Lean and JavaScript...</p>

<p>Yeah, that embedding was good. It definitely makes it easy to make some kinds of interactive pages, in a way that you can play with it.</p>
