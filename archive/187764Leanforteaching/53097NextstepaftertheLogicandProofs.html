<p>Last semester I offer a course using the Avigad book Logic and Proofs. Now the students are asking for a course going deeper in Logics, Theorem Proving and Lean foundations, I possibility is to follow the <code>Theorem Prover in Lean</code>. Any other idea? What would the next steps for students that got interested in dependent types and ITP?</p>

<p>I used Lean in some of my standard maths undergraduate introduction to proof course and it was quite chaotic. Some stuff like functions and equivalence relations go really nicely, except for when you need to explicitly invoke the axiom of choice (e.g. splitting a surjection) -- but I think we have a tactic <code>choose</code> for that now. But a lot of stuff using e.g. the real numbers is very hard for students, because they don't know their way around the library, and <em>everything</em> is hard, e.g. they want transitivity of <code>&lt;</code>, they just don't know where to look. They want distributivity of multiplication over addition -- they don't know what it's called. They want to prove 2 + 2 = 4 -- again they're stuck. </p>
<p>Maybe it would be interesting just to develop a course here on Zulip just teaching the absolute basics of the real numbers. Explain the "mathematician's interface" to the real numbers and document it in a way mathematicians can read. If you put the documentation in a good order then this can be part of the teaching materials. Then just give lots of basic questions about the real numbers in Lean, but introducing things in an order which is natural for Lean, not the random order which is chosen in the maths books. This is always the problem I am having -- mathematicians write books and give lectures in a way which can be difficult to literally translate into Lean. But one can imagine going for a beginnings of analysis course, where all the homework is formalised but the material goes through precisely which lemmas and tactics will be useful for solving the problems. One could start off just showing them how to do basic arithmetic in Lean like a goal of $3^2+4&gt;7$, then show them how to prove basic stuff which they know from school like (x+y)/z=x/z+y/z -- that is not going to be a triviality because z=0 must be dealt with and probably <code>ring</code> isn't going to do it because there's division. Once the students have learnt the basics of how to use the reals as an ordered field <em>then</em> they can start on doing the basic theory of sequences and series. You could target, for example, the sandwich theorem as "a main theorem of the course". </p>

<p>A decent 2nd year maths undergraduate at my university should be able to give you a proof of that theorem on a whiteboard. Why not teach your students to be able to give you a 21st century proof?</p>

<p>I ran an experimental version of this course last year, very informally (it was not for credit or anything), and we tried problems from their actual analysis course in Lean, and it was horrible because there were all these crappy calculations which were such a pain; without <code>linarith</code> (which <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> had only just implemented a month or two before and which was an <em>absolute lifesaver</em> for us) we would have sunk without trace.</p>

<p>The thing it taught me really clearly was that a coherent real analysis course in Lean really looks nothing like a standard real analysis course taught in a maths department. The material needs to be presented in a different way.</p>

<p>I've just deployed a new version of the web editor which has a workaround for the minimum font size issue. You'll have to refresh to get it to look right if you change the mininum font size after you've opened it, but I think that's not too much of a restriction.</p>

<p>Regarding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then just give lots of basic questions about the real numbers in Lean, but introducing things in an order which is natural for Lean, not the random order which is chosen in the maths books. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the most important thing for making things line up better with lean + mathlib is to front load the abstract algebra. STOP USING REALS. Use them as motivation, and then say that we're going to take an axiomatic approach, where we first identify the basic algebraic theorems that reals have and then show their consequences incrementally, first introducing an addition (additive groups), then a multiplication (rings, maybe semirings), then division (fields). Don't touch the actual real numbers until you are actually taking limits.</p>

<p>I don't think it's possible to seriously use mathlib for teaching. We can use mathlib tactics of course, but the mathematical library itself is developed without any pedagogical purpose. Reading mathlib in order to learn basics of real analysis will be exactly as successful as reading Bourbaki, for the same reason.</p>

<p>I still dream of writing a formalized introduction to elementary real analysis, but I think it will have to be largely independent of mathlib. When I think about this I sort of imagine writing axioms for real numbers instead of using mathlib reals. And then define limits in the elementary way, without filters, although there could be an appendix explaining that all those limits can be unified by the filter abstraction. But I'm not writing this because <em>we have a paper to write</em>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> .</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> thank you very much for your ideas. I am curious about how you implemented the page that shows the sandwich theorem, nice interactive document. </p>
<p>I was thinking also in another possible direction. Instead of use Lean to Math,  discuss the foundations of Lean. There are many things I am still trying to learn in this area. For instance, what is the connection between CoC and Martin-Löf type theory? ML type system is also part of the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pure+type+system" target="_blank" title="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pure+type+system">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pure+type+system</a>? </p>
<p>In the use lean line of thouths, the course my have few students, not more than 5. Maybe would be nice to have a list of TODO items in the mathlib or ideas of simple libraries that could be implemented as part of a course?</p>

<p><code>obvious_ineq</code> is a tactic that (I think) Patrick wrote, and it is more or less specially made for the sandwich theorem file?<br>
