<p>I have the following problem: After installing the lean vs code extension and downloading the math library, adding the math library to a workspace results in unresolved imports because the math library is not inside the LEAN_PATH.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the math library needs to be saved inside the lean folder or is there a way to add the path to the math library to LEAN_PATH?</p>

<p>Are you using <code>leanpkg add</code> to set up mathlib?</p>

<p>There are some detailed instructions <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/how-to-install-mathlib-and-keep-it-up-to-date/" target="_blank" title="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/how-to-install-mathlib-and-keep-it-up-to-date/">here</a> which worked for me.</p>

<p>Oh, I didn't, I simply forked the math library from github. Thank you for the link!</p>

<p>I got to the point where lean --version works well but trying to create a project fails to the "failed to start child process" error also documented here: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/lean-user/a3nphm5h2p4" target="_blank" title="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/lean-user/a3nphm5h2p4">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/lean-user/a3nphm5h2p4</a></p>

<p>just my 2 cents, in my case it was because git was not in PATH</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the path variables are set correctly. Maybe I will try the linux installation some time in the future. I think the developers should actually put a lot more attention on making lean accessible to new users. I am comfortable with command line use but doing a project with students would be a nightmare.</p>

<p>I have a working setup on windows 10 and I don't recall ever having to deal with this error. I'm using the bash shell that comes with git for windows "<code>C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.ext</code>", though I'm using it from the program <a href="http://cmder.net" target="_blank" title="http://cmder.net"><code>cmder</code></a>. The only lean-related thing I have in the path (which I placed in my <code>.bashrc</code>) is the path to my lean-nightly directory which is inside something like <code>users\user\Downloads</code>.</p>
<p>When exactly does the failed to start child process error occur, and does it say anything else? Is it when running <code>leanpkg new</code>? We should at least be able to figure out where it's being triggered...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130331">@Hendrik</span> It looks like this issue has been figured out <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/subject/leanpkg/near/134482297" title="#narrow/stream/113488-general/subject/leanpkg/near/134482297">here</a>. One quick solution is simply to try the git-bash shell if you have that installed.</p>
