<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I am trying to prove a version of the triangle inequality for the integers (For a,b integers |a -b| &lt; = |a| + |b|). However, I have run into some trouble. My plan was to define my own version of absolute value for the integers, then carry out a proof by cases where Lean would evaluate the value of the expressions |a - b|, |a|, and |b| to determine the validity of the proof. For example, in the case that (a - b) &gt; 0, a&gt;0, and b&gt;0, then |a - b| = a - b, |a| = a, and |b| = b, so we can conclude that the inequality holds and so on.  However, the most natural way to define absolute value that I have found, say def absVal (a : Z) : Z := if a &lt; 0 then -a else a. Yet, I have no idea to just extract the value of an expression from this definition in the proof rather than getting ite. This is a multipart question. </p>
<p>What cases tactic is the best to use in this case and if you do not mind can you give me a short example of its use?</p>
<p>Is there a better way to define absolute value that does not use ite?</p>
<p>Is there a known statement of the triangle inequality for the real numbers in Lean? A quick google search seems to suggest no, but perhaps I was not looking in the right places.</p>
<p>If the answer to the above question is no, then how would one apply the triangle inequality in analysis proofs in Lean?</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate your assistance.</p>

<p><code>split_ifs</code> is great for this</p>

<p>if you have an <code>if</code> expression in the goal it does cases on the condition and rewrites the <code>if</code> away in each subgoal</p>

<p>I think you have to use an ite for the norm but the split_ifs tactic just breaks you into a small number of cases immediately</p>

<p>The triangle inequality for the reals will be in mathlib although it might be heavily disguised, eg there might be some proof that the reals are a seminormed topological semiring and then a proof that all such semirings satisfy the triangle inequality, or something like that</p>

<p>I think with the way the <code>int</code>s are defined as an inductive data type, you can define <code>abs</code> without <code>ite</code> by pattern matching?</p>

<p>And then instead of the split_ifs tactic you have to use the <code>cases</code> tactic</p>

<p>.... but if you define your function by pattern matching, it's important that you subsequently provide an API for it, so that no one _has_ to prove things using <code>cases</code>.</p>

<p>Would it be unreasonable, if somewhat redundant, to have the triangle inequality for the reals in a a conspicuous place like <code>data.real.basic</code>, given how ubiquitous it is?</p>

<p>You're right,<code>abs_add</code>. I failed to check. Thanks Patrick!</p>
