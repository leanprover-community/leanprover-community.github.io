<p>Yes, we are aiming at both the basis-free theorems that work in general and the dual basis approach in the finite-dimensional case, and their relationship.<br>
If mathlib currently does not make use of ordered bases, we will not start that now; however, there is the map taking a basis vector to its corresponding dual basis vector (which could then be used to transport an order on the first onto the latter).</p>

<p>One thing I would like to look into is porting the stuff about bases to families of elements rather than subsets of the vector space. You get ordered bases for free this way if the index type happens to be ordered</p>
