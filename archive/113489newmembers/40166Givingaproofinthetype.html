<p>I'm getting the type mismatch error: <code>term A has type (rset r X) but is expected to have type (rset (r - 1 + 1) X)</code>. <code>r</code> is a <code>nat</code>, so I understand why this error is happening but I have the assumption <code>r ≥ 1</code> - so how do I express my lemma to convince lean that these types match</p>

<p>(to save anyone looking, it's <code>nat.sub_add_cancel</code> that should solve this)</p>

<p>Aah, the joys of type theory. If r&gt;=1 then perhaps you should have used r' := r-1 with r'&gt;=0 instead? But you'll have to post code to get hints.</p>

<p>This sort of issue can sometimes result in a redesign. I'll dig out the cdga thread to show you type theory at its worst.</p>

<p>Yeah, it turned out to be nicer to express it like that - but this is the sort of thing I feel like I'll come across again, where redesigns don't seem like the right approach</p>

<p>Hopefully you can just insert an appropriate rewrite and it will sort you out. Reid chose an intentionally nasty example, and various solutions were proposed there.</p>
