<p>How can I "unpack" notation like <code>∉</code>, <code>∩</code>, etc.? I want to convert a proposition of the form <code>x ∉ S</code> to <code>x ∈ S → false</code>. Is this possible just definitionally or do I need to apply some lemma?</p>

<p>You'd think just <code>change</code> should work, but it doesn't seem to do anything.</p>

<p>This doesn't directly answer your question (which I think might be more a matter of how to get lean to avoid printing certain notation), but given <code>h : x ∉ S</code> and <code>H : x ∈ S</code>, the term <code>h H</code> is <code>false</code>. For this reason I don't think I've ever needed to change things like you're describing.</p>

<p>But in that case, shouldn't <code>not_forall_not</code> work on something of the form <code>¬∀ (x : S), x ∉ T</code>? It gives me an error <code>invalid rewrite tactic, failed to synthesize type class instance</code>.</p>

<p><code>not_forall_not</code> requires the predicate to be decidable. Try putting <code>local attribute [instance] classical.prop_decidable</code> somewhere above your proof.</p>

<p>That works, thanks. But what exactly does it do? Does it just tell Lean that all propositions are decidable or is there something more? (If so, is it really any different from classical.em?)</p>

<p>Yes, it adds a (local) type class instance that tells Lean all propositions are decidable. It's derived from classical.em.</p>

<p>A lot of things are written using decidability instances, like the <code>if p then _ else _</code> notation. If you're working classically and don't care about decidability, you need that line at the top of your file.</p>

<p>Exactly. <code>em</code> produces a proof, <code>prop_decidable</code> produces data.</p>

<p>Abhi -- whenever you see a <code>failed to synthesize type class instance</code> error this means that the type class inference machine (the square bracket machine) has failed. The error often shows exactly what it has failed to construct (it was trying to fill in a variable you did not give it explicitly because it was in square brackets, and the goal in the error is the type of the term it failed to construct). </p>

<p>shows you that for this function to run in the usual way (i.e. without any messing around with <code>@</code>) Lean needs to get the type class machine to produce a proof of <code>decidable (∃ (x : α), p x)</code>. If <code>p</code> is random then Lean can't do this (because there are examples in computer science where this sort of this really is not decidable). But note that <code> (∃ (x : α), p x)</code> is a proposition, so if you decide to be a mathematician and work in our wonderful world where every proposition is decidable (indeed, in classical mathematics there is no notion of decidability), then you can tell the type class inference machine that this is what you want to do by feeding  the relevant definition into the machine. </p>
<p>Now if you were making the definition "all propositions are decidable" from scratch you could just use the <code>instance</code> keyword instead of the <code>definition</code> one, but in this case the relevant claim that all propositions are decidable is already a definition (<code>classical.prop_decidable</code>) and it's in core Lean. The issue is hence that this definition is not something which the machine knows about. Rob's trick <code>local attribute [instance] classical.prop_decidable</code> (and actually from experience I would recommend instead <code>local attribute [instance, priority 0] classical.prop_decidable</code>) tags the definition with the "instance" tag, which is exactly what you need to do to make the type class inference machine notice it.</p>
<p>You can learn more about type class inference in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/type_classes.html" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/type_classes.html">chapter 10 of Theorem Proving In Lean</a></p>

<p>But back to the original question -- I remember well wanting to know exactly the same as what you want to know now. Here are some tips. </p>
<p>1) Before the statement of whatever you are working on, you can switch notation off completely, by writing <code>set_option pp.notation false</code>. Example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">set_option</span> <span class="n">pp</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="kn">notation</span> <span class="n">false</span>

<span class="bp">#</span><span class="kn">check</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="err">∈</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="bp">@</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">univ</span> <span class="bp">ℕ</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="c1">-- has_mem.mem 1 set.univ : Prop</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you want to unfold even further, there is a command for that: the <code>unfold</code> command. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">set_option</span> <span class="n">pp</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="kn">notation</span> <span class="n">false</span>

<span class="kn">example</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="err">∈</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="bp">@</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">univ</span> <span class="bp">ℕ</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">false</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="k">begin</span>
  <span class="n">unfold</span> <span class="n">has_mem</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">mem</span><span class="o">,</span>
  <span class="n">unfold</span> <span class="n">set</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">mem</span><span class="o">,</span>
  <span class="n">unfold</span> <span class="n">set</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">univ</span><span class="o">,</span>
  <span class="n">sorry</span>
<span class="kn">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on, I wrote a lot of code which looked like this. You can write each line after you've seen the goal at the end of the line before. The <code>unfolds</code> do not change the goal at all (I think), they just change the way it is displayed. So once you've unfolded enough to figure out what's going on you can actually just delete all the <code>unfolds</code>. Also you can write them all in one line (<code>unfold X Y Z ...</code>) (no commas).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> "The unfolds do not change the goal at all" -- the same applies to <code>change</code>, doesn't it? Except you need to actually supply what you want to change things to. I've been using that to clarify things so far. <code>unfold</code> is nice, but with <code>change</code> I can actually figure out the answer without Lean telling me.</p>
