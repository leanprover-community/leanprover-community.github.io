<p>I tried to write a definition of free objects in a category over a type, and what I wrote type-checks, but I'm not certain it does the right thing, and if it does, I suspect there is a cleaner/better way to write it, but I don't know how.<br>
My code does not yet conform to the mathlib library style conventions.<br>
Would anyone be willing to look over my code to evaluate whether it does the right thing, and whether there are substantially better ways I could organize it?</p>

<p>Your lines are a bit long. Also, if you want syntax highlighting on Zulip, wrap your code like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>```lean

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="118229">@drocta</span> I find this code quite hard to parse... you don't seem to be opposed to unicode, since you use <code>∃</code> and <code>∘</code>. So why don't you use <code>u₁ u₂</code> and <code>Type u₁ → Type u₂</code> and  <code>X ⟶ Y</code> to make things more readable?</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback! (have edited the previous comment to include the syntax highlighting)<br>
I had been trying to avoid using unicode characters, but I kind of gave in for the exists-unique and the composition because I didn't see anything that would let me say something like <code>exists! (g : blah) , bluh</code> , and because I didn't remember the ascii way of saying function composition.<br>
But, I suppose I may as well give in and use the long arrow for the morphism types.<br>
Would using it for the short arrows and the subscripts improve the clarity all that much?</p>
<p>I had wanted to use <code>forget</code> without specifying the implicit parameters, or at least to define a version with them filled in before the place that I currently use forget, but when I change the definition to be like that ( :</p>

It no longer type-checks, and I'm not really sure why.<br>
Which is unfortunate, as I feel that that would make it much nicer to read. Though, I guess in that case it doesn't refer to the concrete category <code>my_concrete_category</code> anywhere so it makes some sense to me that it doesn't work.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I don't really understand how the type classes work.<br>
Is there a better way to refer to <code>(X : objects_of_my_concrete_category)</code> which would make the forget calls work without having to specify their implicit arguments?</p>
<p>Thank you again!</p>

<p>I'm not sure why it would fail... I agree that this is sometimes annoying...</p>
