<p>I keep getting "excessive memory consumption" errors in Lean. How can I increase the memory consumption limit? Presumably this is a Lean setting, right?</p>

<p>From the docs for the extension, it's <code>lean.memoryLimit</code> or <code>-M</code> but I'm not sure how to use this.</p>

<p>Have you built your project (e.g. with <code>leanpkg build</code>) recently? The most common reason for running into the memory consumption error is that you don't have up-to-date compiled versions of your dependencies, and so Lean has to do a lot more work every time it processes your file.</p>

<p>You may need to restart the Lean server afterwards too</p>

<p>Yes -- increasing the memory is ironically probably not the way to solve these errors -- you have maybe got buggy code or you need to compile stuff</p>

<p>And whenever you get it you should  restart lean I guess, eg with ctrl shift p lean: restart</p>

<p>Buggy code isn't the issue, since it works after restarting (albeit after a very long time). As for the installation -- I installed from the binaries you (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>) uploaded as of October. Is this too old?</p>

<p>Are you working on mathlib, or your own project which uses mathlib, or something else?</p>

<p>If code takes a long time to run you can try and figure out what's going on by sticking #exit in the code and working out which line is causing the problem. October binaries are fine I'm sure. But there is perhaps a line which is bad style or could be rewritten to solve your problems</p>
