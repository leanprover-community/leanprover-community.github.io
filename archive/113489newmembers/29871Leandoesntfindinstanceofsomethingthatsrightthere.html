<p>Weird problem -- I have my goal, which is <code>(x ⋆ y) → (y ⋆ z) → (x ⋆ z)</code> (for some operation <code>⋆</code>) and I have a hypothesis <code>Hxy : x = y</code>. But when I try <code>rw Hxy,</code> Lean tells me:</p>

<p>Sometimes it's because you have two variables called <code>x</code>, sometimes it's because something needs to be done by type class inference and type class inference fails but the error mesage is that the rewrite failed, there are all sorts of reasons.</p>

<p>Another reason it fails is that you can't rewrite under a binder. Does <code>simp only [Hxy]</code> work? As you can see, it's difficult to diagnose without a MWE.</p>

<p>Ok, I got the problem (it was the "two variables called <code>x</code>" thing) -- I had defined a symbol <code>S</code> for <code>fin 2</code> and mid-way through the proof had done <code>rw S at z y x</code>, which caused two sets of variables <code>x y z</code> to be defined.</p>

<p><code>rw</code> is a fickle beast.</p>

<p>(although I'm not sure why that happened -- usually when you do <code>rw something at something</code>, it just changes the statement, not create new ones.)</p>

<p>Yeah, I've encountered that before, but that actually makes sense (and is useful!). Treating rewrites differently based on whether they're done on a natural number or a proof is just weird.</p>
