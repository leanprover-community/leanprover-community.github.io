<p>I'm getting errors when I try to pattern match on whether a nat is even or odd, but keep getting errors. I thought this was fair game for pattern matching. Is that not the case?</p>

<p>You can't expect the equation compiler to prove that every natural number is of the form 2n or 2n+1 -- this proof has a small amount of content.</p>

<p>Gotcha. It seems like it didn't like the pattern match on the multiplication, rather than the lack of exhaustive cases. Is there a way to add an "otherwise" case like in Haskell? That feels a little silly though.</p>
<p>For context, I wanted to prove this lemma, but Lean didn't like that (-1) wasn't a nat, so I thought I'd do a case split on whether m is even or odd. </p>

<p>Your definition of <code>luc</code> should probably use <code>luc</code> rather than <code>fib</code>, right? For your lemma, I'd just cast everything to <code>int</code> and try to prove it there. Tactics like <code>norm_cast</code> and <code>push_cast</code> should hopefully make the casts easy to deal with.</p>

<p>I was thinking about that. Since they're all positive it seemed like I should be able to use <code>nat</code>, and this expression could be rewritten using nat subtraction instead of -1, but maybe that's not really practical.</p>

<p>It's much easier just to make everything integer-valued if you want to do subtraction. Natural number subtraction is really badly behaved, it is not a function you should use at all if you're doing mathematics.</p>

<p>Right, forgot you could just put a general wildcard with no structure on it. From your earlier post it sounded like the problem was that <code>2*n</code> and  <code>2*n+1</code> didn't register as exhaustive cases for a nat  to the compiler, but it sounds like that's not the extent of why this isn't allowed? Should I just take it as an axiom that you can't pattern match on multiplication then, or is there a deeper reason this doesn't work?</p>

<p>If you are pattern matching on a natural, you can only pattern match on the constructors for that natural, which are zero and succ, or combinations of these constructors (at least as far as I know -- I am no expert in the equation compiler). Note that in the lucas definition, <code>n+2</code> is by definition <code>succ (succ n)</code> so that's OK. But <code>2*n</code> and <code>n*2</code> are definitely not OK.</p>

<p>If you are pattern matching on a natural, you can only pattern match on the constructors for that natural, which are zero and succ, or combinations of these constructors (at least as far as I know -- I am no expert in the equation compiler). Note that in the lucas definition, <code>n+2</code> is by definition <code>succ (succ n)</code> so that's OK. But <code>2*n</code> and <code>n*2</code> are definitely not OK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, that makes sense. For some reason I thought we could pattern match on patterns other than the type constructors.</p>
