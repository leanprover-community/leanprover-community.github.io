<p>I have been fortunate enough to come across this code of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>  <a href="https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-model-categories/blob/top-dev/src/logic/crec.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-model-categories/blob/top-dev/src/logic/crec.lean">https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-model-categories/blob/top-dev/src/logic/crec.lean</a>. Reckon it might be the missing link I need to make progress on my original goal from the top of this thread. (At the same time it was perhaps a little unfortunate that the first thing I ever tried to do in Lean required such trickery <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span>)</p>

<p>Is it likely to get into mathlib any time soon?</p>

<p>My guess: if you ask Reid he won't mind if you just copy and use his code. I don't think he is planning to PR it to mathlib soon (i.e. within a month).</p>

<p>Did two different threads get mixed together by Zulip here?</p>

<p>Zulip doesn't mix threads. But users often do...</p>

<p>The one Mario posted a bit earlier. He labeled it "without tactics".</p>

<p>Yes it looks as if they got mixed together because they have the same name, even though mine has some extra capitals...</p>
