<p>Hello! In section 3.5 of the github book the second code snippet says:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>theorem dne {p : Prop} (h : ¬¬p) : p :=
or.elim (em p)
  (assume hp : p, hp)
  (assume hnp : ¬p, absurd hnp h)
</pre></div>


<p>If you hit "try it!" and delete the (assume hp:p, hp) line it complains. How is hp:p, hp used? Isn't it enough to just assume hnp and h?</p>

<p>The first line splits the proof up into two cases, the case when <code>p</code> is true, and the case when <code>¬p</code> is true. You have to prove both. It will therefore expect two proofs as arguments, one of <code>p -&gt; p</code>, and also a proof of <code>¬p -&gt; p</code>. The second line is a proof of <code>p -&gt; p</code>, and the final line is the proof that <code>¬p -&gt; p</code>.</p>
<p>You can only <code>assume hp : p</code> if you're trying to prove a goal of the form <code>p -&gt; something</code></p>

<p>it complains because or.elim requires you to provide two functions/proofs, one for the left side of the or, one for the right side of the or. <br>
say you want to prove a proposition p, and you're given a ∨ b. then you need to provide two proofs, a → p and b → p.<br>
in your example, you want to prove p, by eliminating the disjunction em p = p ∨ ¬p.<br>
one of these cases is trivial (the first one), and the second one requires you to use your assumption hnp.</p>

<p>personally, i really liked that term mode was introduced first, because it was easier to see what was going on. that being said, my background is cs, so having seen the lambda calculus before reading the book might have influenced that perception ;)</p>

<p>I don't really know lambda calculus stuff, but the first part of the book had a nice exposition. Still, tactics sounds like magic so I am even more interested now!</p>

<p>Ok this is very reassuring, thanks! I'm experiencing that feeling currently. Also I don't properly know where to start with the second exercise at the bottom of the chapter. How would I remove the negation if I can't use false.elim? I believe I'm thinking about this problem altogether in the wrong way (which is why I went back to this section).</p>

<p>You can do induction on any inductive type in Lean, it's pretty crazy. Induction on the natural numbers is normal induction, induction on false is <code>false.elim</code>. That function <code>or.elim</code> is induction on <code>or</code>.</p>

<p>When I get my act together all this will be very well signposted. I'm hoping that I will actually have some kind of coherent story for beginners by the end of July. An alternative introduction to Lean which undergraduate mathematicians might find more accessible than theorem proving in Lean (in the sense that it will get to maths more quickly).</p>

<p>Hmm, this doesn't give e.g. the lean names for the natural deduction inference rules, e.g. or.elim matches the last disjunction rule there, but it's something I put into a pull request the other day taken from the logic &amp; proof book, perhaps it might help? <a href="https://gist.github.com/ratmice/ee5b2d49f8a8c141ddbe9fde798eb4e1" target="_blank" title="https://gist.github.com/ratmice/ee5b2d49f8a8c141ddbe9fde798eb4e1">https://gist.github.com/ratmice/ee5b2d49f8a8c141ddbe9fde798eb4e1</a></p>
