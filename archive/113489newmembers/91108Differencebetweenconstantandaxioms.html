<p>I just noticed that <code>propext</code> is defined as a constant:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">constant</span> <span class="n">propext</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">↔</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Is this an alternative to <code>axiom</code>? What would change if I made it an axiom?</p>

<p>Why are there two different commands then? I would think it may make sense to use <code>axiom</code> for things whose type has type <code>Prop</code> and <code>constant</code> for things whose type has some other type (like a function), but the two examples I've seen are exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>I.e. <code>choice</code> defines a function and is an <code>axiom</code> but <code>propext</code> defines a (unproven) proof and is a <code>constant</code>.</p>

<p>There's no difference between <code>theorem</code> and <code>lemma</code> of course. But for constants and axioms I thought the rule of thumb was that constants were for data and axioms for propositions. As you spotted, this convention does not seem to be being followed here</p>

<p>The main difference between data and propositions in Lean is that Lean remembers how you constructed data but throws away your proof of a proposition and just remembers that it's proved. But of course here with constants and axioms this information doesn't exist, so they feel a lot more similar to each other than theorems and definitions do. If you're brave enough to look at Lean's source code and know enough C++ to understand it then you could maybe just check to see what the difference is.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, <code>propext</code> was an <code>axiom</code> four years ago: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/0da4f191fc2a37e34d53179d5cf924021de4fd15/library/logic/axioms/propext.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/0da4f191fc2a37e34d53179d5cf924021de4fd15/library/logic/axioms/propext.lean">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/0da4f191fc2a37e34d53179d5cf924021de4fd15/library/logic/axioms/propext.lean</a><br>
But yeah, it doesn't matter that much.  In the C++ code, you could tell the difference between axiom and constant, but this is not really used and not exposed to lean either.  Another difference is that you can do <code>meta constant</code> but not <code>meta axiom</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, <code>propext</code> and <code>funext</code> together prove that all proofs (of a proposition) are equal, don't they? Since <code>propext</code> shows that <code>f(trivial) = trivial, g(trivial) = trivial</code> for any two functions <code>f : true \to P</code> and <code>g : true \to P</code>. So does that mean type theories in which proofs are distinct lack <code>propext</code>?</p>

<p>I think the extra "axiom" is not just that all proofs of P are equal, but that they are definitionally equal.</p>

<p>But I see actually, even if it wasn't definitional, then propext would imply that anyway.</p>

<p>Proof relevant type theories tend to lack the type <code>Prop</code> altogether I think. Proof irrelevance is the only thing distinguishing <code>Prop</code> and <code>Type</code> so propositions tend to be defined using <code>Type</code> and some of them I think have an <code>is_Prop</code> predicate that says that the type has only one element.</p>

<p>My recent thoughts about <code>quot</code>, and Mario's comments about them (sparked by Chris' observation that I used quot.sound to prove quot'.sound) made all this a bit clearer to me. There is just a whole bunch of stuff which, if you don't have it, would make maths basically impossible to do, and the CS people have made what appears to a mathematician to be a random small set of this stuff into axioms and then deduced all the rest of it. I'm not sure that the fact that propext is an axiom is remotely important.</p>

<p>When I try writing that proof, though, Lean just changes it to <code>eq.refl H1</code> (when I print it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proof relevant type theories tend to lack the type <code>Prop</code> altogether I think. Proof irrelevance is the only thing distinguishing <code>Prop</code> and <code>Type</code> so propositions tend to be defined using <code>Type</code> and some of them I think have an <code>is_Prop</code> predicate that says that the type has only one element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not true. Impredicativity is also an important difference. I think Coq has Prop for this reason, and no definitional proof irrelevance</p>

<p>I heard once it was an optional extra like <code>propext</code>. Though I guess that means <code>Prop</code> would still be special in the sense that any two proofs are not provably unequal.</p>

<p>but now your impredicative definitions are not helping us to solve the equations, because they are incomputable</p>

<p>yes but we don't care about solving them because that's too hard. We now care about whether the solutions lie on some union of simple subvarieties or something. Nobody will get promoted for solving a Diophantine equation.</p>

<p>Lean is designed for computer science, so impredicative definitions can't be that useless from a computational perspective. You can't compute with them, but you can still use them to help prove your program does what it's supposed to.</p>

<p>By the way, HoTT uses predicative universes only (in the usual setup), so if you thought it would be a great thing that solves all your problems then this is one place where it isn't all sunshine and roses</p>

<p>It's true that in regular math predicativity doesn't really come up, but it shows up in non-absoluteness like Kenny says, or in model theory where adding more ordinals causes new subsets of nat to appear... you have this weird situation where you've built the set but not the elements, and that's where things like Cohen reals come from</p>

<p>Also, we've discussed impredicative encodings of inductive types before, like <code>xnat : Type := \all X : Type, X -&gt; (X -&gt; X) -&gt; X</code>, which doesn't typecheck in lean because <code>Type</code> is predicative</p>

<p>Or when we have an object that is "defined by a universal property" and we want to just write that property but it doesn't work because the universe quantifier isn't large enough, so instead we re-express it by some kind of construction "from below"... that's predicativity</p>
