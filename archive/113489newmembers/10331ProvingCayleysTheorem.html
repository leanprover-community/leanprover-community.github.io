<p>Okay, so as was suggested to me the other day, I think it would be a good idea to prove Cayley's theorem in Lean. I think it would give me a good understanding of how certain mathematical structures are implemented in Lean, and would give me a chance to get some feedback on my code. Below is essentially my outline of a TODO.</p>
<p>Preliminaries: the first thing I need to do is talk about an arbitrary group G, with an operation <code>x</code>. Then I want the set of elements of G, S, defined. Third, I want to define the set F of bijective functions f: S -&gt; S, that is, the set of permutations of S. I assume it would be easiest to first construct this just at injective mappings, and then it should be easy to prove that they are also surjective. Then, I want a construction of function composition within F. The final thing I want to show in my preliminaries is that (F, *) is a group with respect to composition. I assume this might take some bit of doing, since I'll have to show there is an inverse map, and it is in F. This seems like the hardest bit out of the preliminaries, unless there is already something in function.lean that shows a bijective map has an inverse. I will research this.</p>
<p>Now, the proof of the theorem: This much should be the easy part. all I have to do is define the map in F called f_g(x) = g*x, and show that the set of <code>f_g for all g in G</code> is a subgroup of F. That should be simple once I've gotten through the preliminaries.</p>
<p>Please let me know if this looks about right for what I'll end up implementing in Lean. Any tips on how to get started with the preliminaries, or any hints/tips about subtleties in Lean I might be missing would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Mathlib is a maze and it's extremely difficult to navigate it alone. I attempted to document some of what was there when I was just starting out, and I wrote some kind-of useless files, which perhaps helped nobody, but the attempt to write them at least made me look at every single Lean file in mathlib at least once. Of course back then mathlib was 1/3rd the size!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="218940">@Greg Conneen</span> There are two kinds of bijections in Lean; there are functions f : X -&gt; Y equipped with an inverse function g : Y -&gt; X and proofs that fg and gf are identity; those pieces of data are terms of type <code>equiv X Y</code>. There are also functions f : X -&gt; Y plus a proof that these functions are injective and surjective. In constructive mathematics or computable mathematics or whatever weird kind of mathematics some computer scientists do, these two concepts are <em>not the same</em>. The problem is that the statement that f is bijective only gives you a <em>theorem</em> that for all y in Y there exists a unique x in X such that f(x)=y. To define the inverse function g you need an algorithm which spits this x out, i.e. "gets data from a proposition", and this is problematic. Even if f is computable, its inverse might not be -- given the algorithm which computes f, how do you get an algorithm which computes its inverse (especially if X is uncountable?). <code>equiv</code> is the "stronger" notion -- one can prove that equivs are bijective. To get a bijective map from an equiv you will have to struggle a bit more and switch on some stuff which I always have switched on anyway so I can't remember what it is exactly. noncomputability? The axiom of choice? Something like that.</p>

<p>For a general S, an injective function of course isn't bijective. Defining bijective functions in Lean is easy. You should prove that a composite of two injective functions is injective and the composite of two surjective functions is surjective, in tactic mode, as warm-up for this.</p>

<p>PS proving that an injective function from a finite set to itself is also surjective is not easy at all -- you are deluding yourself because you have an extremely accurate but unfortunately very geometric model of a finite set. Lean's definition of a finite set is equivalence classes of lists with no duplicate elements, so any proofs in the API will involve lifting to lists and then proving that things are constant on equivalence classes -- put it another way -- you have to order the set, prove or construct something with the ordered set (typically by induction on the size) and then prove that what you did was independent of the order. This can involve a very delicate induction, because the permutations of a finite set are generated by certain explicit permutations built into Lean. Everything about finite sets is much harder than you think. Fortunately the nice computer scientists wrote a gigantic API for finite sets so that mathematicians can use them the way they like to use them -- but don't be blinded by this -- finite sets are hard, and proving that an injective map is also surjective from first principles is hard.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> how can the proof be that simple? Is our library on groups and functions so extensive that it's practically trivial? I'd like to see your take on the proof. I still plan on doing it in a more roundabout way to help me understand Lean a little better in the process, but it'd be astoundingly beautiful to see a 5-line proof of Cayley's theorem.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> I would love a link to the talk you gave on mathlib, if you'd be so kind.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> I saw how function.lean and data.equiv.basic handled bijections. That makes sense, given how they're defined. I still don't like the notation for <code>equiv</code>, but I suppose it's doable. Secondly, I'd be interested in proving that an injective map f: G -&gt; G is bijective, and similarly when assuming surjectivity. I suppose that's a project for another day.<br>
Lastly, is there anyone in particular to ask about more detailed comments in mathlib files? Not that the comments aren't sufficient, but I would like more mathematicians such as myself to be able to jump headfirst into Lean, and that seems difficult as-is. I know I'm not bringing up any new conversations, and this is a tangential question, but I was wondering who I should ask.</p>

<p>Cayley's theorem can completely be simple. If G is a group then the multiplication map on G can be thought of as a map G -&gt; (G -&gt; G) (indeed in functional programming this is usually how it is stored) and this is exactly the function which embeds G into the permutations. I am confused by all this talk about injective and bijective. I thought G was an arbitrary group. So an injective function G -&gt; G is not bijective. As for comments in mathlib files -- I guess what happened to me was that after a while I realised I didn't need comments, I could just read the code and see what was going on...</p>

<p>G is an arbitrary group, you're right. I was just talking about proving bijectivity since I came across it while studying Lean files that I'm not at all accustomed to. <br>
As for comments... yeah, I guess I'm just not at the point where I'm able to read what's going on all the time. I suppose I just feel sort of stuck in low level Lean proofs since there's just a huge gap between basic proofs on propositions, integers, and the like and actually useful theoretical mathematics, such as algebra and analysis. I'm excited that the proof of Cayley's theorem is so simple, since that says very good things about the people who wrote the files on group theory and functions. But I feel that at the same time, it means I'm learning less about the way mathematics in Lean is formalised with every proof that comes my way. Do you think the best approach is to just read Lean files and use print/check/reduce/eval statements until I understand what's going on? I feel like in order to get comfortable with how mathematical structures are defined in Lean, that's an inevitability. I guess I'm just really excited to get to the high level stuff, but I'm slowly realising how much time that's going to take on my end. Is that the same for all of you, where Lean takes a lot of doing to get from where I am to a clear understanding of much of mathlib?</p>

<p>There is a long process from where you are to being able to write mathlib ready mathematics. The best thing you can do in that direction is pick an area that hasn't been formalized, write some stuff, and post about it here, or PR it. It will probably be torn apart but it's a good learning experience</p>
<p>To read mathlib isn't quite as hard as this; you can do pretty well by going to a file about a theory that interests you, and then browse through it, and figure out what the statements say and what part of the theory is being covered. Ctrl-click on stuff to trace back to prerequisite theorems, and you will start to get a sense of the layout</p>

<p>The thing about mathlib is that one of its philosophies is: if the observation is trivial on paper, then try and make the lean proof an incomprehensible one-liner. Of course a lot of these one-liners are now no longer incomprehensible to me, but I well remember when they were.</p>

<p>Here is a cool project. Prove that there is a bijection between equivalence relations on a set X and partitions of X into disjoint non-empty subsets. Mathematically this is straightforward but needs some basic stuff. You don't have to use typeclasses, which are tricky for beginners because the square bracket system needs to be internalised before you can see what it can do for you. Your job is to construct bijections between two sets and prove that they're bijections by evaluating the compositions and checking you get the identity. You'll learn a lot.</p>

<p>NB proving this might take you longer than you think. Not because it's hard, but because you'll have to learn how to manipulate structures and functions quite extensively, in a mathematically very simple situation. Even formalising the statement is a challenge for a beginner; I can do it for you if you want. You will need to make a structure <code>partitions X</code> such that a term of that type is a partition of X.</p>

<p>This is like the "exercise 6.1" of Lean (forgive the obscure reference to the TeXbook). Proving something which is mathematically very simple and just involves a whole bunch of trivial-to-mathematician observations, in a formal system like Lean, forces you to think very carefully about what a term is, what a type, is, and what the type of everything is. It forces you to learn about how to define functions in Lean whose definitions you completely understand in maths, it forces you to learn about structures and ultimately the amount of code you'll probably end up writing as a beginner is surprisingly large. Then some whizz-kid will show you how it can all be done in a few lines using tricks and you'll begin to see why mathlib chooses 1 line proofs rather than 20 line proofs which are more "readable" -- who wants to read trivialities anyway?</p>

<p>If you want to go even further at the end, you could prove that an equiv from X to Y induces equivs from <code>partition X</code> to <code>partition </code>Y<code> and from </code>setoid X<code> to </code>setoid Y`, and then you could prove that your construction made the square commute. That would be my answer to the question about why the construction we all know is "canonical"</p>

<p>Maybe you can even prove that your construction is an equivalence of categories from the groupoid of setoids to the groupoid of partitions. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> is there enough category theory in core to be able to formalise this statement?

<p>Recently I've got interested in making loads of equivs, because they've been coming up in the way I think about mathematics. An equiv of setoids is just an equiv of the underlying types such that some diagrams involving the binary relations, all commute.</p>

<p>And I can define two setoids to be isomorphic if there existed an equiv and that's some groupoid I guess.</p>

<p>but it throws an error on ex_incl since Lean doesn't know that objects of type subs can have elements, I think. Is something of type subs a (set X)? I assumed that's how Lean would handle it, but now I don't know if I've got the right type for k.</p>

<p>The advantage of staying up to date is that code posted here is more likely to run. Mathlib moves fast and breaks things, and actually seeing your old code break when mathlib breaks is quite interesting, because it's either a change to mathlib which you should know about, or it's because your proof doesn't work any more because it was poorly written.

<p>It's sitting in _target. I installed using elan, but am not at all familiar with the use of elan. I just followed directions on a github ReadMe somewhere.</p>

<p>I believe the recommended way is to use the <code>update-mathlib</code> script. See <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib#obtaining-binaries" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib#obtaining-binaries">this section</a> of the mathlib readme. Since I've installed that script, I just type <code>leanpkg upgrade</code> and then <code>update-mathlib</code> in the root folder of my lean projects. Make sure that your <code>leanpkg.toml</code> has a line that says <code>lean_version = "3.4.2"</code> at the top.</p>

<p>so you are working in a project? Does the project have a toml file? If so, it might be as simple as running "leanpkg upgrade"</p>

<p>Yes, my project has a toml file. It does in fact have 3.4.2 as the version number</p>

<p>Do you mean that the curl command to install update-mathlib threw an error? What was the error?</p>

<p>No. That didn't throw an error. Once I was done updating, it told me to run another command</p>
