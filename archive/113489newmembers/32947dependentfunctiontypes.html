<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to understand the description of dependent function types as given in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/dependent_type_theory.html#dependent-types" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/dependent_type_theory.html#dependent-types">Section 2.8 of Theorem Proving in Lean</a>. I think I follow up to the end of this paragraph:</p>
<p>"It is clear that cons α should have type α → list α → list α. But what type should cons have? A first guess might be Type → α → list α → list α, but, on reflection, this does not make sense: the α in this expression does not refer to anything, whereas it should refer to the argument of type Type. In other words, assuming α : Type is the first argument to the function, the type of the next two elements are α and list α. These types vary depending on the first argument, α."</p>
<p>My next guess for the type of cons might be something like λ α : Type, α → list α → list α. Is this what is being done, but with Π instead of λ? The next paragraph seems to make it more complicated than that:</p>
<p>"This is an instance of a Pi type, or dependent function type. Given α : Type and β : α → Type, think of β as a family of types over α, that is, a type β a for each a : α. In that case, the type Π x : α, β x denotes the type of functions f with the property that, for each a : α, f a is an element of β a. In other words, the type of the value returned by f depends on its input."</p>
<p>Can I just set <code>α</code> to <code>Type</code> to get what I expected from this? Is this essentially what has been done in the code block later on:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">universe</span> <span class="n">u</span>

<span class="kn">constant</span> <span class="n">list</span>   <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u</span>

<span class="kn">constant</span> <span class="n">cons</span>   <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">Π</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="n">α</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As an aside, why does list have the type that is given here?</p>
<p>If I replace Type with ℕ in the quoted paragraph then I get:</p>
<p>"Given α : ℕ and β : ℕ → Type, think of β as a family of types over ℕ, that is, a type β a for each a : ℕ. In that case, the type Π x : ℕ, β x denotes the type of functions f with the property that, for each a : ℕ, f a is an element of β a. In other words, the type of the value returned by f depends on its input."</p>
<p>This seems to be hinting at what might be needed for the type of functions operating on lists of arbitrary lengths, if β : ℕ → &lt;a type involving list ℕ&gt;?</p>
<p>In summary, why is the description of Π types more complicated than I expected? Is it something along the lines of the example of lists of an arbitrary length?</p>

<p>It's a good guess, but the problem is that <code> λ α : Type, α → list α → list α</code> is not a type. It is a function that takes a type and returns a type. That is, <code>(λ α : Type, α → list α → list α) : Type -&gt; Type</code></p>

<p>So this function acts something like <code>list</code>, which also has this same type (let's ignore universes for now). You can't write <code>x : list</code> because <code>list</code> is not a type. <code>x : list A</code> makes sense if <code>A</code> is a type</p>

<p>Your replacement was inconsistent. You replaced α with ℕ  in most places, not Type with ℕ. Generally you can't treat <code>Type</code> and <code>ℕ</code> the same because <code>Type</code> is a universe and <code>ℕ</code> is not. That is, the elements of Type have elements but the elements of nat don't. If <code>A : Type</code> then<code>x : A</code> makes sense, but if <code>3 : ℕ</code> then <code>x : 3</code> doesn't make sense</p>

<p>Oops. I think I meant:<br>
"This is an instance of a Pi type, or dependent function type. Given ℕ : Type and β : ℕ → Type, think of β as a family of types over ℕ, that is, a type β a for each a : ℕ.

<p>I guess my question is then, why is the type of a dependent function not Π x : Type, β x?</p>

<p>That is, why is β not a function from types to types.</p>

<p>The difference between lambda and Pi is that lambda is used to construct the terms, and Pi is used to construct the types. For example <code>X\to Y</code> is a type, and <code>\lam x, f x</code> is a term of that type, if <code>f</code> is a function from <code>X</code> to <code>Y</code>.</p>
<p>The type of a dependent function is <code>Pi x : X, f x</code> where X can be any type, and f is a function which takes terms of type X and spits out anything. Sure <code>X</code> can be <code>Type</code>. Do you have any questions still?</p>

<p>"In that case, the type Π x : α, β x denotes the type of functions f with the property that, for each a : α, f a is an element of β a".</p>
<p>Does "is an element of" in this sentence mean "has the type"? That is, "In that case, the type Π x : α, β x denotes the type of functions f with the property that, for each a : α, f a has the type β a"?</p>

<p>technically, "having the type" is not a proposition, it's just a thing that is true when you have this construction. That is, if <code>f : Π x : α, β x</code> and <code>a : α</code> then <code>f a : β a</code>.</p>
