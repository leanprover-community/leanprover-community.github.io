<p>I was wondering if anyone might have advice on a learning path for getting to the point of being able to make useful contributions to the goal of easing the use of computer proof assistants like Lean. I have spent some time studying mathematical logic, primarily from "First Order Mathematical Logic" by Angelo Margaris, and I have started going through "Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism" by Morten Heine Sørensen and Pawel Urzyczyn (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC" target="_blank" title="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC">https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC</a>). In some respects there seems to be a bit of a catch-22 here, having the mathematics from these texts available in a fully formalized fashion would be an aid to understanding them, but first needing that understanding to formalize them or to understand their formalization. Nevertheless, I am making progress in these, but it is time consuming, so I would like to be sure that it is a good approach. I am also curious as to the kind of open problems in the field.</p>

<p>My strategy was : read Theorem Proving In Lean, think of some hard problems, try to solve them, get stuck, ask loads of questions here, and then people start realising where the true bottlenecks are</p>

<p>I do not specifically know those texts but that seems like a good approach. You have to be ok with things being slow at first</p>

<p>TBH if you're looking for a textbook Coq has way more mindshare at the moment, you may work through Software Foundations and some of the harder exercises in CPDT in Coq. At that point you're a year or two in and a whiz, and then you come back and pick up Lean since most things are similar...</p>

<p>I would say also most people don't use Lean/Coq to implement programs because specifying and proving program behavior is exceedingly tedious</p>

<p>I have been hesitant to start learning Coq because it appears designed for backward reasoning with tactics, and I would like to create proofs with forward reasoning so that they are readable outside of the proof assistant. Can I use forward reasoning with Coq, or automatically convert tactic style proofs to term style proofs that are readable outside of Coq?</p>

<p>Yes you can reason any way you see fit in both Coq and Lean. I wouldn't say either of the tools is designed for either of the options, although backwards reasoning if of some preference in mechanized environments simply because you don't end up cluttering your goals with redundant assumptions (as much).</p>

<p>I genuinely don't know why computer scientists seem to make so much fuss about forward v backward reasoning. This concept is never thought about in mathematics, a logical argument is a logical argument and who cares which order the steps go in. Can anyone enlighten me as to why this sort of thing seems to come up again and again in the CS community?</p>

<p>I think it's primarily because it is actually a difference between "natural proving style" on paper vs on the computer</p>

<p>but in a computer proof it's generally easier and more structured to approach proofs like this, where the forward proving steps are the exception, not the norm</p>

<p>It's a style question. Like I said, if you saw someone prove an entire proof using "it suffices to prove" (I mean like 10+ uses of this), it would be disorientating</p>

<p>On the other hand, you might claim you're doing backwards reasoning but when I see 3000+ line files like multiset.lean consisting of lemma after lemma after lemma with three-line proofs, you're doing forward reasoning really.</p>

<p>Your backwards / forwards reasoning discussion seems to be going on at a micro-level -- within the proof of one lemma. If you wrote all the lemmas backwards in multiset.lean it wouldn't compile.</p>

<p>I'm saying I write the last lemma first, and work backwards, typing upward in the file</p>

<p>in the end it looks like I wrote in forward order</p>

<p>I think it might be a lemma v theorem thing. We prove theorems forwards and you prove lemmas backwards, and then we say we do things in different order. But we don't give the proofs of lemmas because they're trivial, and you prove lemmas in the right order, so we're both doing things the same way really, but focussing on different aspects.</p>

<p>I only prove lemmas in textual order if I happen to be sufficiently forward thinking to predict the lemmas in advance</p>

<p>Whereas we don't prove them at all, because the fact that you can do induction on multisets is trivial.</p>

<p>As a computer scientist and software engineering guy, I've come to the conclusion that the phrase,  "backwards reasoning", is not as clarifying as it could be. When we use (apply and.intro _ _), for example, sure, we can think of "going backwards through the arrow to the premises", and all that. But a better way to think of what we've done is to give a complete proof, albeit with a few remaining holes. We then recursively fill the remaining "stubs" (aka holes) by applying the same method recursively. In the software design and engineering field, this is known as top-down, structured programming. A better term might be top-down, type-guided development. The "How to Design Programs" intro CS curriculum taught at Brown, UBC, Northeastern, and other places, emphasizes exactly this type-driven, top-down approach. That said, they teach it in Racket, which doesn't have a proper type system (at least the variant of Racket that students encounter early on). </p>
<p>What I'm teaching my students this semester is what I humorously tell them is my "How To Design Proofs" approach. Look at the form of the goal: the top-level quantifier or connective. Select a proof-constructing function (inference rule or previously proven theorem) that can construct a proof of that form. Apply that "rule" leaving zero or more of its arguments to be filled in later, i.e., "stub out the subroutines". They then appear as sub-goals. Apply the same approach recursively to each sub-goal. If you really get stuck, maybe you picked the wrong proof-building function, so backtrack and try again. How To Design Proofs. --Kevin Sullivan</p>

<p>I don't think of it as strange. It is just that to me the resulting proof seems hard to read and comprehend, especially outside of the IDE.</p>
