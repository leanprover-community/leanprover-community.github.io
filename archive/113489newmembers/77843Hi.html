<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I'm a graduate student at MIT. I'm new to Lean, but I've been interested in learn about Lean (and might actually get onto it now that it's summer). Anyway, I have a few talented high school students (i.e. comfortable with a good chunk of undergraduate math) and they've been looking for stuff to do over the summer. It seems to me that this might be an appropriate place for them to find something to contribute to - but I'm a bit unfamiliar as to  what's already done / being worked on etc. I would really appreciate it if someone could give me some pointers. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>To give you an idea: at the moment it is a gigantic task to show that the derivative of <code>exp</code> is <code>exp</code>. And indeed, this task has not been done yet.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Is it really a gigantic task? This is just a question of showing a power series can be differentiated term by term within its radius of convergence. I guess we're still waiting for the differentiation API but <em>gigantic</em>? Isn't it just a bit tedious and long?</p>

<p>Thanks for all the references -- it makes sense that first projects by beginners are unlikely to be appropriate for the maths library but that's absolutely fine. I'll probably be back with more concrete questions later, once I learn some of the basics first :)</p>

<p>Hi all, I'm new too, and my uninformed opinion is that analysis is much harder to formalize than algebra, topology, category theory... because of the many different definitions one could make about such simple objects as <code>exp</code>.  As someone remarked on MathOverflow, <code>exp</code> has three natural definitions: power series, inverse to log=\int dx/x, and lim(1+x/n)^n. If we want to prove a specific fact about <code>exp</code>, we could choose the easiest definition for that purpose; but for a formalization project, we'd need to have all three, and prove their equivalence. It's further complicated by the fact <code>exp</code> is also a complex-analytic object.</p>
<p>Same goes with (constructions of) real numbers.</p>

<p>I think one thing that is perhaps holding up analysis is that maybe we don't know (at least I certainly don't know) what the optimum level of generality is. For example it wouldn't be hard to prove the theorems from a real analysis course on convergent series, but it's clearly not the right level of generality.</p>

<p>But I never learned enough analysis to know what the correct level of generality is</p>

<p>Johannes made multivariate polynomials but it became clear quickly that we still needed single-variable ones so Chris made them too.</p>

<p>I think I did them wrong though. All the structure should have come from <code>mv_polynomial</code> first to shorten the theory</p>

<p>Exactly. An obvious first goal would be the fundamental theorem of calculus, and there already are multiple issues with the level of generality, the least of which being "Are functions real-valued or complex-valued?" (if you have Cauchy's integral formula in mind), or as Bourbaki would have it, taking values in a topological vector space? I always felt this was excessive, but when I did sit down and try to write it down, that's what I ended up too...</p>
<p>Do remember that Bourbaki (or Weil in particular) started out trying to write a text for analysis, which finally came after volumes of algebra and topology—though it was only "functions of a single real variable" and doesn't seem to have much on convergence of series, if I recall. It's probably at the optimum level of generality as it gets.</p>
<p>Not totally unrelated, isn't there a rumor that Bourbaki was working on a volume on differentiable manifolds, and Grothendieck wanted to base it on sheaves and categories... We all wonder what it would have been like if Grothendieck had his way.</p>

<p>Analytic functions in several variables are done in proper generality for instance in Mujica, complex analysis in Banach spaces (see the first chapter there). But this will be so much more complicated than one single variable that I think it is definitely worth it to do a separate theory in one variable (first, and probably keep it forever). Complex analysis in one variables also has several features that simply do not exist in several variables.</p>
