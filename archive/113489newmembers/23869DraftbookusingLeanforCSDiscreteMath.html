<p>mathjax certainly won't prevent you from getting  HTML+LaTeX from the same source, it's quite the contrary. I don't understand how you can blame Jeremy. <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof">https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof</a> certainly uses mathjax</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok,, we'll take another look. Clearly needs fixing. Apologies to Jeremy. Will fix when time permits. Right now fairly slammed getting context edited and out to my students.</p>

<p>I finally had the time to go over 3. Observations are for the most part just nitpicks.<br>
In 3.4.(6) is missing?<br>
a) Formalization of <code>false'</code> is simply <code>inductive false' : Prop</code>, then I guess <code>example : false' ↔ false := iff.intro (λcontra : false', contra.cases_on _) (λcontra : false, contra.cases_on _)</code> is pertinent there. <br>
In 3.5.6<br>
a) <code>example : true' ↔ true := iff.intro (λh : true', true.intro) (λh : true, true'.intro)</code> could be handy here<br>
In 3.6.3.2.<br>
a) I may have missed some previous occurences but it appears that here is the first time you curry a function (<code>sumOfSqaures</code>) - this "works" in combination with my previous comment 2.4.5/b<br>
In 3.7.4.<br>
a) Hahah, there really appears to be no mp in core Lean;  I guess function application is enough :).  Anyway, in your example you provide two interpretations, written in different styles. You "missed" my absolute favourite ones, once again have to do with currying: <code>def arrow_elim' { P Q : Prop } (pimpq: P -&gt; Q) : (P -&gt; Q) := pimpq</code>- note that the parens around the return (P -&gt; Q) are redundant, but under this particular interpretation, it's clear that this thing is really just identity, so then this follows: <code>def arrow_elim'' { P Q : Prop } : forall (pimpq : P -&gt; Q), forall p : P, Q := id</code> where the proof itself is just id! (Lean can figure out that this is the identity for (P -&gt; Q), or you could even be explicit and say <code>:= @id (P -&gt; Q)</code>. Furthermore, might be worth noting this is basically Haskell's <code>($) :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b</code>, which Lean has too, but I believe it's some baked-in syntax in Lean because of... reasons. (You can't do <code>#check ($)</code> in Lean).<br>
In 3.7.5.<br>
a) I would help with <code>todo: give better example</code> but I am not sure what exactly youre trying to demonstrate here :P<br>
In 3.10.4.7.<br>
a) altImplication should have implicit P Q<br>
In 3.11.<br>
a) It could be perhaps instructive to show that exists can be built from forall and by extension, show dependent pairs / Sigmas, as I believe I saw Pi being mentioned somewhere.</p>

<p>These are terrific comments. Thank you very much. I'm tied up with another project but will come back to this in a few days. Very much appreciated. Thanks, again. More soon enough. -Kevin</p>
