<p>Hi everybody,<br>
I am Nga Ngo, from Thang Long University in Hanoi, Vietnam. I have been studying lean to formal some theorems several months. Nice to be friend with all of you.</p>

<p>Welcome to Zulip! If you have any questions. Just ask! It's the way we've all learned Lean. (Except for some frienly wizards, who seem to have known Lean before it was invented.)</p>
