<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> Could you have a look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/927" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/927">#927</a>? It looks great to me, and it is a prerequisite for a refactor of <code>fderiv</code> in terms of bounded linear maps that Jean Lo is planning, and that will play an important role for all the manifold stuff I am aiming for (especially for higher smoothness).</p>

<p>Sure thing. Today is really hectic, but I promise, I'll do it first thing tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Thanks for the review. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> would you like to put together the summary for the review thread on github? You probably have better insights about what working with the bundled maps would be like in practice, as well as the coercion/rewrite issue.</p>
<p>Also, do we know what's happening with the tests? The branch compiles on my system, so I think the Lean code is probably okay, but appveyor/travis are complaining about install scripts again.</p>

<p>Now that this is merged, here's a small report on the status of the <code>deriv</code> refactor. It's being done on a branched called <code>refactor-deriv</code>, and the current state of the relevant file can be found here:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/refactor-deriv/src/analysis/normed_space/deriv.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/refactor-deriv/src/analysis/normed_space/deriv.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/refactor-deriv/src/analysis/normed_space/deriv.lean</a></p>
<p>Most of it is really straightforward edits changing assumptions and just swapping out the corresponding terms in the proofs. Nearly all of the results have been restated &amp; proven using bundled maps now. The only thing that I haven't been able to make work was the proof for the uniqueness of the derivative, in which I ran into some trouble with <code>simpa</code>. Unfortunately, I don't expect to be able to return to this in quite a while.</p>

<p>I've taken the liberty to finish that proof</p>

<p>There was a comment on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/927" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/927">#927</a> by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> that he would prefer a self-contained implementation avoiding as much as possible <code>is_bounded_linear_map</code>. Based on the initial PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/725" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/725">#725</a> by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132889">@Jean Lo</span> , I have prepared such an implementation in # 955. I am essentially happy with both approaches (the current one, and the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/955" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/955">#955</a> one, with a slight preference for <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/955" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/955">#955</a>). <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> , I would be happy to read your comments on this.</p>

<p>The refactor of <code>deriv.lean</code>, together with some additions &amp; corrections to <code>operator_norm.lean</code>, has now been PR'd as <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/956" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/956">#956</a> (Thanks so much <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130980">@Jan-David Salchow</span> .)</p>
<p>I haven't tried replacing the files and see if things compile yet, but I think the changes here should be compatible with <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/955" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/955">#955</a> with minimal editing. The refactor also — I think — removes all the code in mathlib that presently depends on <code>is_bounded_linear_map</code>, so makes it possible to remove it entirely as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> suggests in the comments on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/927" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/927">#927</a> .</p>
