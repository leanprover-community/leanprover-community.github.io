<p>Not really a monster PR, as a good part of it is mostly boring boilerplate, but necessary to make sure than all natural functions one might want to use are indeed there. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/41cdebbc91e326c6a702f0b9ef7935fe853b4e66/src/analysis/normed_space/deriv.lean#L555" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/41cdebbc91e326c6a702f0b9ef7935fe853b4e66/src/analysis/normed_space/deriv.lean#L555">https://github.com/sgouezel/mathlib/blob/41cdebbc91e326c6a702f0b9ef7935fe853b4e66/src/analysis/normed_space/deriv.lean#L555</a> and at the next 400 lines, say :)</p>

<p>Many further things are needed to prove (without add hoc arguments) that the derivative of <code>exp</code> is <code>exp</code>: power series, term by term differentiation, and one-dimensional derivative. I am not going in this direction, my goal is to do manifolds and I don't need <code>exp</code> for this -- well, until I do Lie groups...</p>

<p>Except that to prove anything serious on manifolds I will need partitions of unity, and for this I will need bump functions, and for this I need to know that <code>exp(1/x)</code> is infinitely flat, and for this I need the derivative of <code>exp</code>. It is really hard to construct anything serious when the bases are not here yet!</p>

<p>Defining it would not be too bad, but proving all the useful bits is a lot of work. I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span>  mentioned he wanted to give this to a student.</p>

<p>Nice! Paula Neeley has done the product rule and has been specializing definitions to the univariate case. When the semester is over, I'll help her clean up the code and do a pull request. And yes, another student, Zhouhang Zhou, has been working on the Bochner integral, and will be working on that over the summer. If there is any danger of a bottleneck (i.e. someone can't do something because they are waiting for something else) let me know and we can try to work around it.</p>

<p>If your student wants a nice project, I think singular (co)homology would be awesome. I mean, interesting to do, not completely crazy, and incredibly useful.</p>

<p>For instance. Fix <code>x</code>, and consider the set of points <code>y</code>for which <code>d(f(y),f(x)) &lt;= C d(x,y)</code> where <code>C</code>is larger than an upper bound on your derivative. I claim that it is closed (clear by continuity) and open (use the definition of the derivative with <code>o</code>). Then it is everything.</p>

<p>First, automation to show that a complicated function, built out of elementary pieces, is differentiable. I.e., apply iteratively all the rules differentiable.add, differentiable.sub, differentiable.smul, and so on. This is just a matter of setting up a list of the theorems one wants to apply, and try to apply iteratively all of them, except that <code>apply</code> does not work very well in this context (known bug or limitation, I think, when there are too many forall's in definitions you need to help <code>apply</code> by providing just the right number of underscores).This kind of thing would also be needed for continuity, for measurability, and so on.</p>
<p>And second, automation to check that the derivative of a function is given by some other function, again by applying iteratively the algorithmic formulas for the derivative until there is nothing left.</p>
