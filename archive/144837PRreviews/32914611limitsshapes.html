<p>The concepts in this PR have stalled for a long time. What do we want to do... I think everyone has agreed that it could be merged... and everyone has some gut feeling that it might need refactoring in the future. I propose we just go for it, and refactor once we understand what a better approach is. (Or maybe we discover that this actually works quite fine.) I'm a bit sad that we can't move forward with elementary category theory, because a lot depends on being able to talk about binary products, etc...<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> As maintainer, please feel free to impose a decision.</p>
<p>If we think that sparse categories (as in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/hott/algebra/category/constructions/finite_cats.hlean#L22" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/hott/algebra/category/constructions/finite_cats.hlean#L22">https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/blob/master/hott/algebra/category/constructions/finite_cats.hlean#L22</a>) are a useful concept that should be included, let's have that discussion, and create a PR. It should not be too hard to port that code over from Lean 2.<br>

<p>I'm definitely in favour of merging. I have a student who's already using this branch successfully. I agree that having both <code>square</code> and <code>cosquare</code> is terrible, and I'd like to reinvestigate just using <code>opposite</code> more here, but I think that can happen later.</p>
