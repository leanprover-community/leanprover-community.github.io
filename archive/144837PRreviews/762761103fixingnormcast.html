<p>I initially posted this on general, but I think it's more suited to this stream:</p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I'm was working on fixing a problem with the norm_cast tactic, and it seems like I broke something in data/list.<br>
The thing is, this part of the code doesn't use norm_cast, and doesn't seem to use coercion at all for that matter.<br>
Plus, the error messages I get are about the equation compiler and pattern matching.<br>
Could someone take a look and help me figure out what I'm looking at?<br>
Here is the incriminated commit: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1103/commits/4daf46595da984c2947a771d269e9acd64b0afc1" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1103/commits/4daf46595da984c2947a771d269e9acd64b0afc1">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1103/commits/4daf46595da984c2947a771d269e9acd64b0afc1</a></p>

<p>okay so it appears I was importing data.num that was itself importing data.vector,<br>
and list/basic must import my tactic at some point even so it doesn't use it.<br>
this creates an ambiguity aroun the '::' notation.<br>
so my question is, is there a way to mask a notation I just imported, or explicitely not include in with my import?</p>
