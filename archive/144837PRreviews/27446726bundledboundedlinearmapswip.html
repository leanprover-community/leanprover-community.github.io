<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> not at all. &amp; it's really exciting to finally see derivatives in mathlib!</p>
<p>I would like to make an attempt at proving some miscellaneous things about bounded linear maps in the meantime, then.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I've become quite fond of working with <code>linear_map</code> as a bundled structure — is there any chance there's a way to have that sort of interface  for <code>bounded_linear_maps</code> alongside the formulation  (as a subspace of the k-linear maps from E to F) currently in <code>operator_norm</code>? Or would that just horrifically mangle the code and make things confusing?</p>

<p>I suggest to refactor operator_norm so as to use the bundled version. We should remove the unbundled one.</p>

<p>In amsterdam, I did a live demo on derivatives, and the first thing I did was rewrite <code>is_bounded_linear_map</code> as a structure. I think it's well worth it</p>

<p>Not noteworthy enough for a whole separate PR and not even sure if it's a helpful thing to have done, but I spent some time filling in the gaps in a bundled version of bounded operators.</p>
<p>Nothing's been refactored — <code>bounded_linear_map</code> as a structure exists alongside <code>bounded_linear_maps</code> as a subspace of <code>linear_map</code>, and <code>op_norm</code> alongside <code>operator_norm</code>; most/all of the results stated for <code>bounded_linear_maps</code> over reals have just been reproduced for <code>bounded_linear_map</code> over arbitrary <code>normed_field</code>s, so in particular no breaking changes have been inflicted upon <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> 's nice fréchet derivative code.</p>

<p>I have force-pushed. Things appear to be sane. Sorry for the silliness.</p>
<p>re: arbitrary normed field: things in <code>normed_space/deriv</code> in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/748" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/issues/748">#748</a> appear to always be stated for normed space over reals, but I've really not read through nearly enough of it to say anything constructive about how hard/easy it'd be to make the proofs there work in greater generality.</p>

<p>thanks! I've tossed in a commit that removes the spurious assumptions (got to love division by zero) and second one containing all the instances except for the <code>ring_theory/algebra</code> one.</p>
<p>the <code>vector_space</code> instance was done in the trivial, verbose, there's-probably-something-simple-that-oneshots-this way — I don't know nearly enough lean &amp; I'd love to learn of a better way to state the instance if someone'd point it out.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you need to learn to stop worrying and love division by zero <span aria-label="nuclear" class="emoji emoji-2622" role="img" title="nuclear">:nuclear:</span>. This is a three stages process. First you need to realize you couldn't <em>state</em> this thing (even the original version with extra assumptions) without division by zero. Then you get happy users of your lemma, because they get fewer proof obligations. And then, according to people who worked on large scale formalization such as the odd order theorem, if you don't have that kind of tricks, then at some point there is a phase transition and you get completely stuck.</p>

<p>About the instance, one could indeed automate this, but I don't have time for this now. This could be a nice exercise in reading the tactic tutorial and then the <code>pi_instance</code> and <code>subtype_instance</code> tactics, and then see what you can do here</p>

<p>so the instance for <code>algebra k (bounded_linear_map k E E)</code> is there now, but importing <code>ring_theory.algebra</code> appears to also have done things that I don't know about and now one of the old proofs about <code>operator_norm</code> has a max-class-instance-resolution-depth error. (I tried the obvious thing of tweaking the max_depth but it either just takes longer to fail, or turns everything into deterministic timeouts.) Maybe I should go figure out which exact instance it's been failing to find, and including it by hand? What's the best practice in this case?</p>
<p>&amp; thanks for the pointers; I'll go look at those tactics and hopefully make the instances nicer once I've done that.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I have been bad about reviewing duties. The work by Jan-David and Jean looks nice, but I am not following it closely. Do I need to take a closer look? <br>
As to generalizing normed spaces over the reals to an arbitrary normed field: I think it should work because ultimately every scalar appears inside a norm that maps it to a real anyhow. But I just tried it and the elaborator blew up on me. I added a comment to the PR that shows what I tried. I don't have time or energy now to figure out what is going wrong, but I'd be happy if someone can get it to work.</p>

<p>Looks great! Except for the overly short proof of the chain rule at the end. How about adding enough information so that someone who wants to know how to prove the chain rule can learn it from the formal proof (without feedback from Lean), and then merging?</p>

<p>Look at it this way. If you Google the chain rule, you find the mess of a proof I linked to earlier: <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2216797/frechet-derivative-chain-rule" target="_blank" title="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2216797/frechet-derivative-chain-rule">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2216797/frechet-derivative-chain-rule</a>. It would be really nice if the mathlib repository, online, gave a more precise and elegant proof. If you add four lines of <code>have</code>s, anyone can follow along.</p>

<p>I don't mind inscrutably clever proofs when they abbreviate tedious, straightforward, and uninteresting details. But when our proof scripts start obscuring the interesting mathematical ideas, they become less useful, and we are missing an opportunity to teach and explain.</p>

<p>Sorry that I've been away and this has been in development limbo for a while — I PR'd <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/802" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/802">#802</a> because I invoked the lemma in a proof for continuity → boundedness for nontrivial normed fields; <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/829" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/829">#829</a> implements that proof in the meantime for <code>is_bounded_linear_map</code> with <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/802" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/802">#802</a> as a dependency. Now that <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/802" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/802">#802</a> has gone through, my intention was to PR that continuity → boundedness proof stated for <code>bounded_linear_map</code>, at which point all of the theorems originally stated in the file (alongside some new ones) would have been reproduced for the bundled version, and I wanted to move on to maybe either do some generic functional analysis stuff or refactor some of <code>analysis/derivative</code>.  But some changes to mathlib while I wasn't paying attention seem to have turned much of my not-yet-PR'd code into type class inference hell, so that'll take a while to fix.</p>

<p>Hmmm.... sorry for the pain. I hope fixing it is not too hard. I've found that a lot of errors are saying that type class search maxed out. Increasing the search depth from the default (32) to 40 usually already helps a lot.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip. It turned out less awful than I thought it was &amp; increasing the search depth did fix most of it, and the other errors that are being thrown seem to be mostly superficial.</p>
<p>Currently I'm spending some time on a tentative attempt at refactoring <code>analysis.deriv</code>: stating things with <code>bounded_linear_map</code> seems to help simplify some theorems quite a bit. <code>analysis.deriv</code> seems to be the only file at the moment that depends on <code>is_bounded_linear_map</code>, so it might be viable to remove the old code soon if this goes well (and, of course, if we actually <em>want</em> this bundled thing.)</p>
<p>In the meantime I figured I should wait a little for the verdict on the nontrivial normed field stuff in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/829" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/829">#829</a> : with luck that'd make the continuity→boundedness proof a lot less ad-hoc.</p>
<p>Hope these things I'm doing/trying to do sound more or less sensible?</p>

<p>As a result of some discussion earlier today on github (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/726#issuecomment-481191842" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/726#issuecomment-481191842">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/726#issuecomment-481191842</a>), this PR should probably be superseded by <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/919" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/919">#919</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/919" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/919">#919</a> Is basically most of this PR except changes to <code>deriv.lean</code>, except most/all of the duplication &amp; clutter that's resulted from me being confused while struggling to keep up with mathlib have been removed. The intention is to sort out any problems in this before filing a separate PR for the derivative stuff.</p>

<p>Sorry about this. We've just recently updated the PR merge process, in the hope of making it easier on the maintainers. I think right now it's best if you create a branch on the <code>leanprover-community/mathlib</code> repository, and then make a PR from your branch to <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>If you don't have the ability to create branches on leanprover-community, ping any of the maintainers (I'm not sure the exact list - Mario, Chris, Patrick, ....?)</p>
