<p>Mathematicians find it frustrating when their goal is "obviously the same" as a hypothesis, except the hypothesis is about integers and the goal is about real numbers. These docs attempt to give some hints about how to deal with this, plus a slightly more in-depth discussion about what is going on for those who are interested. Comments are welcome.</p>

<p>I suggested to fix two typos, and had two other minor comments. See my review on Github.</p>

<p>I was struck by the comment "your goal is <code>↑x * ↑y = ↑z</code>, something which you suspect is a statement about real numbers", which reminds me that in HoTT they always write <code>Path ℝ (↑x * ↑y) ↑z</code>. We can get goals like <code>⊢ @eq real x y</code> with <code>pp</code> options, but as soon as you throw in coercions or operator syntax, it's unreadable... I'm dreaming of more laser-focused <code>pp</code> options that would just show the types of coercions or equalities in a nice way</p>

<p>Unfortunately it doesn't work because <code>pp.notation</code> (on by default) hides the implicit arguments of the operators, and setting that to false makes up most of the mess that <code>pp.all</code> causes</p>

<p>Aargh. My PR is not quite ready. My plan was to give a recipe so that undergraduate mathematicians had an algorithm to deal with any such "easy in maths" issues they came up with. But I've just found one that does not seem to be covered by what I wrote:</p>

<p>The first one is fine. For the second one, I am hoping for a proof which does not require knowing the explicit name of the theorem that says that two rationals are equal iff the corresponding reals are equal. You can see that in the first example I did not need to know the name of any theorem in mathlib; there are 5 choose 2 such theorems and ideally I would like students not to have to know their names explicitly. How do I solve the second goal? I would like to add this to the docs but I don't know myself (in the past I've just found the name of the theorem and applied it directly)</p>

<p>The point of the docs was to show 1st year mathematicians an algorithm for proving everything of this nature which is "trivial in maths". The algorithm currently only relies on the students knowing <code>rw</code> and <code>simp</code> but if we cannot do this one with these tools then of course I am going to have to tell them about more tools</p>

<p>I understand how to get from <code>\u a + \u b = \u c</code> to <code>\u (a + b) = \u c</code> and hopefully I explain that in the docs. The trick which beginners can use is to prove <code>\u a + \u b = \u (a + b)</code> using <code>simp</code> and then rewrite.</p>

<p>If it is the "initial" function for N,Z,Q, it's named after the source (because it can't be named after the target, which is generic) and it's called <code>cast</code>. The functions <code>int.coe_nat</code> and <code>complex.of_real</code> are separate for reasons, and they (and other such specialized functions) are usually named by the target. More generally, the rule of thumb is it's named after whatever is introduced last</p>

<p>The reason I am interested in these questions is that they come up in real life and I am being asked them again and again by beginners attempting to do mathematics. Just a simple question such as "prove that the square root of 2 is irrational" is fraught with these difficulties. The numerator of a rational is an int, the denominator is a nat, and getting from <code>q ^ 2 = 2</code> to <code>n ^ 2 = 2 * d ^ 2</code> (the latter in int) is hard for beginners. And then getting from this to a statement about q not being <code>sqrt 2</code>in the reals is hard again. The fact that I've just been teaching this stuff in M1F means that these questions come up, and my docs are an attempt to resolve these issues once and for all. The reason I think this is important is that it's exactly the "trivial in maths, hard in Lean" phenomenon which puts beginners off, and once they're gone, I've lost them.</p>

<p>My understanding is that <code>simp</code> knows the right lemma in most cases, but applies things in the wrong order and gets stuck (it simplifies <code>\u 3</code> to 3). The iff statement corresponding to<code>int.of_nat_inj</code> should perhaps be a simp lemma, and if I've got this right then that kills the last example.</p>

<p>I had to cheat an tell it "use the coersion bundle of lemmas",<br>
we have a cute little command <code>suggestion coes</code> to do this</p>
<p>To get it I just stripped out the body of the <code>begin...end</code> block and inserted a call to <code>rewrite_search {trace_result := tt}</code> instead<br>
And yeah <code>rewrite_search!</code> just cheats</p>

<p>Actually I didn't even need to write <code>suggestion coes</code>, I just needed to <em>create</em> the coes bundle, which didn't exist until it needed to just now. Rewrite search can detect its getting desperate and searches through its library of things to see if any bundle of things "coersions, category_theory, arithmetic, etc." are applicable and it starts trying the detected most relevant ones. This is still pretty crude though, we want to minimise the amount of handling like this</p>
<p>That's right. I mean, so long as you give it access to <code>simp</code> (which it doesn't have without the bang) it is just like a shotgun version of <code>simp</code>, which should be at least as strong</p>

<p>I don't really understand what is being said. I generated that long begin end proof with simp. Proving the equalities is not the problem, proving the injectivity of the coercions is the problem</p>

<p>I mentioned that I suspect the code could be made a lot tidier, and he suggested that I post it again in this stream. Would be very grateful if I could get some guidance with maybe taking something like this further as a tactic that makes dealing with coercions more straightforward for beginners?</p>

<p>I guess my dream would be a tactic which takes as input a hypothesis which a mathematician would find indistinguishable from the goal (ie the same modulo coercions) and solves the goal. Is that asking too much?</p>

<p>It cannot Chris, but maybe it is just missing a lemma. If you strip the body of that proof and replace it with a call to <code>tidy</code> I get two goals (this is with the suped-up <code>tidy</code> of Scott's category theory library though, so mathlib tidy might be different). Do the goals you get look reasonable? I just looked very quickly and couldn't tell if they were nonsense or not.</p>

<p>I think beginners would be rightly confused about the randomness of this. I am dreaming of a failsafe <code>cast_num</code> tactic which can replace <code>simp</code> here and which would solve every case. I do not know anything about <code>rewrite_search!</code> other than the fact that it doesn't seem to be in my mathlib -- sorry -- I've not been following these tactic developments. But this post is supposed to be some sort of indication as to what my <del>minions</del>clients would be after.</p>
