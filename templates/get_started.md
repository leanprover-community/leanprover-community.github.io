# Get started with Lean

There are two ways for you to start interacting with Lean. Installing it on your own computer
will give you the most satisfactory experience. However some Lean projects offer ways of
interacting with them via the cloud, which requires no local installation.

## Without a local installation

If you only want to try Lean without installing it, you can try running it in
the cloud using Gitpod or GitHub codespaces. For instance you can read
the book [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) while 
doing the exercises [on Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean). 
Note this Gitpod option requires you to create an account somewhere. Note also that 
Gitpod is being deprecated in April 2025.

## Installing Lean and creating a project

The important thing to know about a local installation is that it is a two step process. 
First you need to install the software. But this is not enough; to run Lean on a file,
the file must be part of a Lean project. 

Once you have installed Lean, you can either install a Lean project from the internet
(for example the [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/)
project) or you can create your own project.

The recommended way to install Lean and to get working with a project is to follow the
[instructions in the official Lean manual](https://docs.lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html).
The manual explains a simple point-and-click method for both installing Lean, and creating
or downloading a project.

After you have followed these instructions, you'll probably want to [learn Lean](learn.html)!

## Command line
