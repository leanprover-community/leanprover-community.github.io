# Get started with Lean

We have installation instructions for the following operating systems:

* [Debian/Ubuntu](install/debian.html)
* [Other linux](install/linux.html)
* [MacOS](install/macos.html)
* [Windows](install/windows.html)
* [Docker](install/docker.html)

After this installation procedure, it is crucial to read how to start or
get a [Lean project](install/project.html). And of course you'll
probably want to [learn Lean](learn.html)!

If you only want to try Lean without installing it, you can try running it in
the cloud using Gitpod or GitHub codespaces. For instance you can read
the book [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) while doing the exercises [on Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean). Note this Gitpod option requires you to create an account somewhere.
