# Documentation style

All pull requests must meet the following documentation standards. See
[the `doc-gen` repo](https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4) for information about the
[automatically generated doc pages](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/).

You can preview the markdown processing of a GitHub page or pull request
using the [Lean doc preview page](https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/github-lean-doc-preview).

## Header comment

Each mathlib file should start with:
* a header comment with copyright information (see the [recommendations in our style guidelines](style.html#header-and-imports));
* the list of imports (one on each line);
* a module docstring containing general documentation, written
  [using Markdown and LaTeX](#latex-and-markdown).

(See the example below.)

Headers use atx-style headers (with hash signs, no underlying dash).
The open and close delimiters `/-!` and `-/` should appear on their own lines.

The mandatory title of the file is a first level header. It is followed by a summary of the content
of the file.

The other sections, with second level headers are (in this order):
* *Main definitions* (optional, can be covered in the summary)
* *Main statements* (optional, can be covered in the summary)
* *Notations* (omitted only if no notation is introduced in this file)
* *Implementation notes* (description of important design decisions or interface features,
  including use of type classes and `simp` canonical form for new definitions)
* *References* (references to textbooks or papers, or Wikipedia pages)
* *Tags* (a list of keywords that could be useful when doing text search in mathlib to find where
  something is covered)

References should refer to bibtex entries in [the mathlib citations file](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/docs/references.bib).
See the [Citing other works](#citing-other-works) section below.

The following code block is an example of a file header.

# p-adic norm

This file defines the `p`-adic norm on `ℚ`.

The `p`-adic valuation on `ℚ` is the difference of the multiplicities of `p` in the numerator and
denominator of `q`. This function obeys the standard properties of a valuation, with the appropriate
assumptions on `p`.

The valuation induces a norm on `ℚ`. This norm is a nonarchimedean absolute value.
It takes values in {0} ∪ {1/p^k | k ∈ ℤ}.

## Implementation notes

Much, but not all, of this file assumes that `p` is prime. This assumption is inferred automatically
by taking `[Fact p.Prime]` as a type class argument.

## Doc strings

Every definition and major theorem is required to have a doc string.
(Doc strings on lemmas are also encouraged, particularly if the lemma has any mathematical content
or might be useful in another file.)
These are introduced using `/--` and closed by `-/` above the definition, with either newlines or
single spaces between the markers and the text.
They can contain Markdown and LaTeX as well: see the next section. If a doc string is a complete
sentence, then it should end in a period. Named theorems, such as the **mean value theorem** should be bold faced (i.e., with
two asterisks before and after).

Doc strings should convey the mathematical meaning of the definition. They are allowed to lie
slightly about the actual implementation. The following is a doc string example:

```lean
/-- If `q ≠ 0`, the `p`-adic norm of a rational `q` is `p ^ (-padicValRat p q)`.
If `q = 0`, the `p`-adic norm of `q` is `0`. -/
def padicNorm (p : ℕ) (q : ℚ) : ℚ :=
  if q = 0 then 0 else (p : ℚ) ^ (-padicValRat p q)
```

An example that is slightly lying but still describes the mathematical content would be:

```lean
/-- `padicValRat` defines the valuation of a rational `q` to be the valuation of `q.num` minus the
valuation of `q.den`. If `q = 0` or `p = 1`, then `padicValRat p q` defaults to `0`. -/
def padicValRat (p : ℕ) (q : ℚ) : ℤ :=
  padicValInt p q.num - padicValNat p q.den
```

The `docBlame` linter lists all definitions that do not have doc strings. The `docBlameThm`
linter will lists theorems and lemmas that do not have doc strings.

To run only the `docBlame` linter, add the following to the end of your lean file:
```
#lint only docBlame
```
To run only the `docBlame` and `docBlameThm` linters, add the following to the end of your lean
file:
```
#lint only docBlame docBlameThm
```
To run the all default linters, including `docBlame`, add the following to the end of your lean
file:
```
#lint
```
To run the all default linters, including `docBlame` and run `docBlameThm`, add the following to
the end of your lean file:
```
#lint docBlameThm
```

## LaTeX and Markdown

We generally put references to Lean declarations or variables in between backticks. Writing
the fully-qualified name (e.g. `finset.card_pos` instead of just `card_pos`) will turn the name
into a link on our [online docs](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/).

Raw URLs should be enclosed in angle brackets `<...>` to ensure that they will be clickable online.
(Some URLs, especially those with parentheses or other special symbols,
may not be parsed correctly by the markdown renderer.)

When talking about mathematical symbols instead, it may be preferable to use LaTeX. LaTeX can be
included in doc strings in three ways:
- using single dollar signs `$ ... $` to render math inline,
- using double dollar signs `$$ ... $$` to render math in "display mode", or
- using environments `\begin{*} ... \end{*}` (without dollar signs).

These correspond to the [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/basic/mathematics.html) settings
of our online docs. The interaction between the Markdown and LaTeX there is similar to that on
<https://math.stackexchange.com> and <https://mathoverflow.net>, so you can paste a doc string into
[an editing sandbox there](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4666/sandbox-for-drafts-of-long-complex-posts)
to preview the final result. See also the math.stackexchange
[MathJax tutorial](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).


## Sectioning comments

It is common to structure a file in sections, where each section contains related declarations.
By describing the sections with module documentation `/-! ... -/` at the beginning,
these sections can be seen in the documentation.

While these sectioning comments will often correspond to `section` or `namespace` commands,
this is not required. You can use sectioning comments inside of a section or namespace, and you can
have multiple sections or namespaces following one sectioning comment.

Sectioning comments are for display and readability only. They have no semantic meaning.

Third-level headers `###` should be used for titles inside sectioning comments.

If the comment is more than one line long, the delimiters `/-!` and `-/` should appear on their own
lines.

See [Lean/Expr/Basic.lean](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib/Lean/Expr/Basic.lean) for an example in practice.

```lean
namespace BinderInfo

/-! ### Declarations about `BinderInfo` -/

/-- The brackets corresponding to a given `BinderInfo`. -/
def brackets : BinderInfo → String × String
  | BinderInfo.implicit => ("{", "}")
  | BinderInfo.strictImplicit => ("{{", "}}")
  | BinderInfo.instImplicit => ("[", "]")
  | _ => ("(", ")")

end BinderInfo

namespace Name

/-! ### Declarations about `name` -/

/-- Find the largest prefix `n` of a `Name` such that `f n != none`, then replace this prefix
with the value of `f n`. -/
def mapPrefix (f : Name → Option Name) (n : Name) : Name := Id.run do
  if let some n' := f n then return n'
  match n with
  | anonymous => anonymous
  | str n' s => mkStr (mapPrefix f n') s
  | num n' i => mkNum (mapPrefix f n') i
```

## Theories documentation

In addition to documentation living in Lean files, we have [theories documentation](../theories.html)
where we give overviews spanning several Lean files, and
more mathematical explanations in cases where formalization requires slightly exotic points of view,
see for instance the [topology documentation](../theories/topology.html).

## Citing other works

To cite papers and books in doc strings, the references should first be added
to the BibTeX file: `docs/references.bib`. To normalize the file with `bibtool`, you
can run:

```text
bibtool --preserve.key.case=on --preserve.keys=on --print.use.tab=off --pass.comments=on -s -i docs/references.bib -o docs/references.bib
```

To ensure that your citations become links in the online docs, you can use either of the
following two styles:

First, you may enclose the citation key used in `docs/references.bib` in square brackets:

```markdown
The proof can be found in [Boole1854].
```

In the online docs, this will become something like:

> The proof can be found in [[Boo54]](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/references.html)

(The key will change into an [`alpha` style label](https://www.bibtex.com/s/bibliography-style-base-alpha/)
and become a link to the [References page](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/references.html)
of the docs.)

Alternatively, you can use custom text for the citation by putting text in square brackets
ahead of the citation key:

```markdown
See [Grundlagen der Geometrie][hilbert1999] for an alternative axiomatization.
```

> See [Grundlagen der Geometrie](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/references.html) for an alternative axiomatization.

Note that you currently cannot use the closing square bracket `]` symbol in the link text.
So the following will not result in a working link:

```markdown
We follow [Euclid's *Elements* [Prop. 1]][heath1956a].
```

> We follow [Euclid's *Elements* [Prop. 1]][heath1956a].
