# Library Style Guidelines
Author: [Jeremy Avigad](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad)

In addition to the [naming conventions](naming.html),
files in the Lean library generally adhere to the following guidelines
and conventions. Having a uniform style makes it easier to browse the
library and read the contents, but these are meant to be guidelines
rather than rigid rules.

### Variable conventions

- `u`, `v`, `w`, ... for universes
- `Œ±`, `Œ≤`, `Œ≥`, ... for generic types
- `a`, `b`, `c`, ... for propositions
- `x`, `y`, `z`, ... for elements of a generic type
- `h`, `h‚ÇÅ`, ...     for assumptions
- `p`, `q`, `r`, ... for predicates and relations
- `s`, `t`, ...      for lists
- `s`, `t`, ...      for sets
- `m`, `n`, `k`, ... for natural numbers
- `i`, `j`, `k`, ... for integers

Types with a mathematical content are expressed with the usual
mathematical notation, often with an upper case letter 
(`G` for a group, `R` for a ring, `K` or `ùïú` for a field, `E` for a vector space, ...).
This convention is not followed in older files, where greek letters are used
for all types. Pull requests renaming type variables in these files are welcome.


### Line length

Lines should not be longer than 100 characters. This makes files
easier to read, especially on a small screen or in a small window.

### Header and imports

The file header should contain copyright information, a list of all
the authors who have made significant contributions to the file, and
a description of the contents. Do all `import`s right after the header,
without a line break, on separate lines. 

```lean
/-
Copyright (c) 2015 Joe Cool. All rights reserved.
Released under Apache 2.0 license as described in the file LICENSE.
Author: Joe Cool.
-/
import data.nat
import algebra.group
```

(Tip: If you're editing mathlib in VS Code, you can write `copy`
and then press <kbd>TAB</kbd> to generate a skeleton of the copyright header.)

Regarding the list of authors: we don't have strict rules on what
contributions qualify for inclusion there. The general idea is that
the people listed there should be the ones we would reach out to if we had
questions about the design or development of the Lean code.

### Module docstrings

After the copyright header and the imports,
please add a module docstring (delimited with `/-!` and `-/`) containing

- a title of the file,
- a summary of the contents (the main definitions and theorems, proof techniques, etc‚Ä¶)
- notation that has been used in the file (if any)
- references to the literature (if any)

In total, the module docstring should look something like this:
```markdown
/-!
# Foos and bars

In this file we introduce `foo` and `bar`,
two main concepts in the theory of xyzzyology.

## Main results

- `exists_foo`: the main existence theorem of `foo`s.
- `bar_of_foo`: a construction of a `bar`, given a `foo`.
- `bar_eq`    : the main classification theorem of `bar`s.

## Notation

 - `|_|` : The barrification operator, see `bar_of_foo`.

## References

See [Thales600BC] for the original account on Xyzzyology.

```

New bibliography entries should be added to `docs/references.bib`.

See our [documentation requirements](doc.html) for more suggestions and examples.

### Structuring definitions and theorems

These guidelines hold for declarations starting with `def`, `lemma` and `theorem`. For "theorem statement", also read "type of a definition" and for "proof" also read "definition body".

Use spaces around ":", ":=" or infix operators. Put them before a line break rather
than at the beginning of the next line.

Use two spaces to indent.

After stating the theorem, we generally do not indent the first line
of a proof, so that the proof is "flush left" in the file.
```lean
open nat
theorem nat_case {P : nat ‚Üí Prop} (n : nat) (H1 : P 0) (H2 : ‚àÄ m, P (succ m)) : P n :=
nat.induction_on n H1 (assume m IH, H2 m)
```

If the theorem statement requires multiple lines, indent the subsequent lines:
```lean
namespace nat

lemma le_induction {P : ‚Ñï ‚Üí Prop} {m}
  (h0 : P m) (h1 : ‚àÄ n, m ‚â§ n ‚Üí P n ‚Üí P (n + 1)) :
  ‚àÄ n, m ‚â§ n ‚Üí P n :=
by { apply nat.less_than_or_equal.rec h0, exact h1 }

def decreasing_induction {P : ‚Ñï ‚Üí Sort*} (h : ‚àÄ n, P (n + 1) ‚Üí P n) {m n : ‚Ñï} (mn : m ‚â§ n)
  (hP : P n) : P m :=
le_rec_on mn (Œª k ih hsk, ih $ h k hsk) (Œª h, h) hP

end nat
```

When a proof term takes multiple arguments, it is sometimes clearer, and often
necessary, to put some of the arguments on subsequent lines. In that case,
indent each argument.
```lean
open nat
axiom zero_or_succ (n : nat) : n = zero ‚à® n = succ (pred n)
theorem nat_discriminate {B : Prop} {n : nat} (H1: n = 0 ‚Üí B) (H2 : ‚àÄ m, n = succ m ‚Üí B) : B :=
or.elim (zero_or_succ n)
  (assume H3 : n = zero, H1 H3)
  (assume H3 : n = succ (pred n), H2 (pred n) H3)
```
Don't orphan parentheses; keep them with their arguments.

Here is a longer example.
```lean
open list
variable {T : Type}

theorem mem_split {x : T} {l : list T} : x ‚àà l ‚Üí ‚àÉ s t : list T, l = s ++ (x::t) :=
list.rec_on l
  (assume H : x ‚àà [], false.elim (iff.elim_left (mem_nil_iff _) H))
  (assume y l,
    assume IH : x ‚àà l ‚Üí ‚àÉ s t : list T, l = s ++ (x::t),
    assume H : x ‚àà y::l,
    or.elim (eq_or_mem_of_mem_cons H)
      (assume H1 : x = y,
        exists.intro [] (exists.intro l (by rw H1; refl)))
      (assume H1 : x ‚àà l,
        let ‚ü®s, (H2 : ‚àÉ t : list T, l = s ++ (x::t))‚ü© := IH H1,
            ‚ü®t, (H3 : l = s ++ (x::t))‚ü© := H2 in
        have H4 : y :: l = (y::s) ++ (x::t), by rw H3; refl,
        exists.intro (y::s) (exists.intro t H4)))

```

A short declaration can be written on a single line:
```lean
open nat
lemma succ_pos : ‚àÄ n : ‚Ñï, 0 < succ n := zero_lt_succ

def square (x : nat) : nat := x * x
```

A "have" / "from" pair can be put on the same line.
```lean
have H2 : n ‚â† succ k, from subst (ne_symm (succ_ne_zero k)) (symm H),
[...]
```
You can also put it on the next line, if the justification is long.
```lean
have H2 : n ‚â† succ k,
  from subst (ne_symm (succ_ne_zero k)) (symm H),
[...]
```
If the justification takes more than a single line, keep the "from" on the same
line as the "have", and then begin the justification indented on the next line.
```lean
have n ‚â† succ k, from
  not_intro
    (assume H4 : n = succ k,
      have H5 : succ l = succ k, from trans (symm H) H4,
      have H6 : l = k, from succ_inj H5,
      absurd H6 H2)))),
[...]
```

When the arguments themselves are long enough to require line breaks, use
an additional indent for every line after the first, as in the following
example:
```lean
open nat eq algebra
theorem add_right_inj {n m k : nat} : n + m = n + k ‚Üí m = k :=
nat.rec_on n
  (assume H : 0 + m = 0 + k,
    calc
        m = 0 + m : eq.symm (zero_add m)
      ... = 0 + k : H
      ... = k     : zero_add _)
  (assume (n : nat) (IH : n + m = n + k ‚Üí m = k) (H : succ n + m = succ n + k),
    have H2 : succ (n + m) = succ (n + k), from
      calc
        succ (n + m) = succ n + m   : eq.symm (succ_add n m)
                 ... = succ n + k   : H
                 ... = succ (n + k) : succ_add n k,
    have H3 : n + m = n + k, from succ.inj H2,
    IH H3)
```

In a class or structure definition, we do not indent fields, as in:

```lean
structure principal_seg {Œ± Œ≤ : Type*} (r : Œ± ‚Üí Œ± ‚Üí Prop) (s : Œ≤ ‚Üí Œ≤ ‚Üí Prop) extends r ‚âºo s :=
(top : Œ≤)
(down : ‚àÄ b, s b top ‚Üî ‚àÉ a, to_order_embedding a = b)

class semimodule (R : Type u) (M : Type v) [semiring R]
  [add_comm_monoid M] extends distrib_mul_action R M :=
(add_smul  : ‚àÄ (r s : R) (x : M), (r + s) ‚Ä¢ x = r ‚Ä¢ x + s ‚Ä¢ x)
(zero_smul : ‚àÄ x : M, (0 : R) ‚Ä¢ x = 0)
```

When using a constructor taking several arguments in a definition,
arguments line up, as in:

```lean
theorem sub_eq_zero_iff_le {a b : ordinal} : a - b = 0 ‚Üî a ‚â§ b :=
‚ü®Œª h, by simpa [h] using le_add_sub a b,
 Œª h, by rwa [‚Üê le_zero, sub_le, add_zero]‚ü©
```

When defining instances, opening and closing braces are not alone on
their line. The content is indented by two spaces and `:=` line up, as
in:

```lean
instance : partial_order (topological_space Œ±) :=
{ le          := Œª t s, t.is_open ‚â§ s.is_open,
  le_antisymm := assume t s h‚ÇÅ h‚ÇÇ, topological_space_eq $ le_antisymm h‚ÇÅ h‚ÇÇ,
  le_refl     := assume t, le_refl t.is_open,
  le_trans    := assume a b c h‚ÇÅ h‚ÇÇ, @le_trans _ _ a.is_open b.is_open c.is_open h‚ÇÅ h‚ÇÇ }
```

### Hypotheses Left of Colon

Generally, having arguments to the left of the colon is preferred
over having arguments in universal quantifiers or implications, 
if the proof starts by introducing these variables. For instance:

```lean
example (n : ‚Ñù) (h : 1 < n) : 0 < n := by linarith
```

is preferred over

```lean
example (n : ‚Ñù) : 1 < n ‚Üí 0 < n := Œª h, by linarith
```

and

```lean
example (n : ‚Ñï) : 0 ‚â§ n := dec_trivial
```

is preferred over

```lean
example : ‚àÄ (n : ‚Ñï), 0 ‚â§ n := Œª n, dec_trivial
```

### Binders

Use a space after binders:
```lean
example : ‚àÄ Œ± : Type, ‚àÄ x : Œ±, ‚àÉ y, y = x :=
Œª (Œ± : Type) (x : Œ±), exists.intro x rfl
```

### Calculations

There is some flexibility in how you write calculational proofs. In
general, it looks nice when the comparisons and justifications line up
neatly:
```lean
import data.list
open list
variable {Œ± : Type}

theorem reverse_reverse : ‚àÄ (l : list Œ±), reverse (reverse l) = l
| []       := rfl
| (a :: l) := calc
    reverse (reverse (a :: l)) = reverse (concat a (reverse l))     : rfl
                           ... = reverse (reverse l ++ [a])         : concat_eq_append
                           ... = reverse [a] ++ reverse (reverse l) : reverse_append
                           ... = reverse [a] ++ l                   : reverse_reverse
                           ... = a :: l                             : rfl
```

To be more compact, for example, you may do this only after the first line:

```lean
import data.list
open list
variable {Œ± : Type}

theorem reverse_reverse : ‚àÄ (l : list Œ±), reverse (reverse l) = l
| []       := rfl
| (a :: l) := calc
    reverse (reverse (a :: l))
          = reverse (concat a (reverse l))     : rfl
      ... = reverse (reverse l ++ [a])         : concat_eq_append
      ... = reverse [a] ++ reverse (reverse l) : reverse_append
      ... = reverse [a] ++ l                   : reverse_reverse
      ... = a :: l                             : rfl
```


### Tactic mode

When opening a tactic block, `begin` is not indented but everything
inside is indented, as in:

```lean
lemma div_self (a : Œ±) : a ‚â† 0 ‚Üí a / a = (1:Œ±) :=
begin
  intro hna,
  have wit_aa := quotient_mul_add_remainder_eq a a,
  have a_mod_a := mod_self a,
  dsimp [(%)] at a_mod_a,
  simp [a_mod_a] at wit_aa,
  have h1 : 1 * a = a, from one_mul a,
  conv at wit_aa {for a [4] {rw ‚Üêh1}},
  exact eq_of_mul_eq_mul_right hna wit_aa
end
```

A more complicated example, mixing term mode and tactic mode:
```lean
lemma nhds_supr {Œπ : Sort w} {t : Œπ ‚Üí topological_space Œ±} {a : Œ±} :
  @nhds Œ± (supr t) a = (‚®Öi, @nhds Œ± (t i) a) :=
le_antisymm
  (le_infi $ assume i, nhds_mono $ le_supr _ _)
  begin
    rw [supr_eq_generate_from, nhds_generate_from],
    exact (le_infi $ assume s, le_infi $ assume ‚ü®hs, hi‚ü©,
      begin
        simp at hi, cases hi with i hi,
        exact (infi_le_of_le i $ le_principal_iff.mpr $ @mem_nhds_sets Œ± (t i) _ _ hi hs)
      end)
  end
```

When new goals arise as side conditions or steps, they are enclosed in
focussing braces and indented (except possibly the last goal, if its proof
is much longer than the proofs of the other goals). Braces are not alone on their line.

```lean
lemma mem_nhds_of_is_topological_basis {a : Œ±} {s : set Œ±} {b : set (set Œ±)}
  (hb : is_topological_basis b) : s ‚àà (ùìù a).sets ‚Üî ‚àÉ t ‚àà b, a ‚àà t ‚àß t ‚äÜ s :=
begin
  rw [hb.2.2, nhds_generate_from, infi_sets_eq'],
  { simpa [and_comm, and.left_comm] },
  { exact assume s ‚ü®hs‚ÇÅ, hs‚ÇÇ‚ü© t ‚ü®ht‚ÇÅ, ht‚ÇÇ‚ü©,
      have a ‚àà s ‚à© t, from ‚ü®hs‚ÇÅ, ht‚ÇÅ‚ü©,
      let ‚ü®u, hu‚ÇÅ, hu‚ÇÇ, hu‚ÇÉ‚ü© := hb.1 _ hs‚ÇÇ _ ht‚ÇÇ _ this in
      ‚ü®u, ‚ü®hu‚ÇÇ, hu‚ÇÅ‚ü©, by simpa using hu‚ÇÉ‚ü© },
  { suffices : a ‚àà (‚ãÉ‚ÇÄ b), { simpa [and_comm] },
    { rw [hb.2.1], trivial } }
end
```

The final step in a `begin ... end` block may be followed by comma,
but there is no style rule requiring it.
(Many authors prefer the comma, so that placing the cursor after it displays "goals accomplished"
in the infoview, but others dislike it on the basis of the disconcerting grammar.)

Often `t0; t1` is used to execute `t0` and then `t1` on all new goals. But `;` is not a `,` so
either write the tactics in one line, or indent the following tacic.

```lean
begin
  cases x;
    simp [a, b, c, d]
end
```

For single line tactic proofs (or short tactic proofs embedded in a term),
it is preferable to use `by ...` rather than `begin ... end`.

If you are using multiple tactics inside a `by ...` block, use braces
`by { tac1, tac2 }` rather than abusing the `;` operator `by tac1; tac2`,
which should only be used when multiple goals need to be processed by `tac2`.
(This style rule is not yet followed in the older parts of mathlib.)

In general, you should put a single tactic invocation per line, unless you are
closing a goal with a proof that fits entirely on a single line. Short sequences of
tactics that correspond to a single mathematical idea can also be put on a single line,
as in `cases bla, clear h` or `induction n, { simp }` or `rw [foo], simp_rw [bar]`.

```lean
begin
  by_cases h : x = 0,
  { rw h, exact hzero ha },
  { rw h,
    have h' : ..., from H ha,
    simp_rw [h', hb],
    ... }
end
```

Very short goals can be closed right away using `swap` or `work_on_goal` if needed, to avoid
additional indentation in the rest of the proof.

```lean
begin
  rw [h], swap, { exact h' },
  ... 
end
```

We generally use a blank line to separate theorems and definitions,
but this can be omitted, for example, to group together a number of
short definitions, or to group together a definition and notation.

### Normal forms

Some statements are equivalent. For instance, there are several equivalent
ways to require that a subset `s` of a type is nonempty. For another example, given
`a : Œ±`, the corresponding element of `option Œ±` can be equivalently written 
as `some a` or `(a : option Œ±)`. In general, we try to settle
on one standard form, called the normal form, and use it both in statements and
conclusions of theorems. In the above examples, this would be `s.nonempty` (which
gives access to dot notation) and `(a : option Œ±)`. Often, simp lemmas will be
registered to convert the other equivalent forms to the normal form.

There is a special case to this rule. In types with a bottom element, it is equivalent
to require `hlt : ‚ä• < x` or `hne : x ‚â† ‚ä•`, and it is not clear which one would 
be better as a normal form since both have their pros and cons. An analogous situation
occurs with `hlt : x < ‚ä§` and `hne : x ‚â† ‚ä§` in types with a top element. Since it is very 
easy to convert from `hlt` to `hne` (by using `hlt.ne` or `hlt.ne'` depending
on the direction we want) while the other conversion is more lengthy, we use `hne` in
*assumptions* of theorems (as this is the easier assumption to check), and `hlt` in 
*conclusions* of theorems (as this is the more powerful result to use). 
A common usage of this rule is with naturals, where `‚ä• = 0`.

## Comments

Use module doc delimiters `/-! -/` to provide section headers and
separators since these get incorporated into the auto-generated docs,
and use `/- -/` for more technical comments (e.g. TODOs and
implementation notes) or for comments in proofs.
Use `--` for short or in-line comments.

Documentation strings for declarations are delimited with `/-- -/`.

See our [documentation requirements](doc.html) for more suggestions
and examples.
