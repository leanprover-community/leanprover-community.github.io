# Simp

The `simp` tactic works by applying a conditional term rewriting system to try and prove, or at
least simplify, your goal. What this basically means is that `simp` is equipped with a list of
lemmas (those tagged with the `simp` attribute), many of which are of the form `X = Y` or `X iff Y`,
and attempts to match subterms of the goal with the left hand side of a rule, and then replaces the
subterm with the right hand side. The system is conditional in the sense that lemmas are allowed to
have preconditions (`P -> (X = Y)`) and in these cases it will try and prove the precondition using
its simp lemmas before applying `X = Y`.

You can watch `simp` in action by using `set_option trace.simplify true` in your code. For example

```lean
namespace hidden

definition cong (a b m : ℤ) : Prop := ∃ n : ℤ, b - a = m * n

notation a ` ≡ ` b ` mod ` m  := cong a b m
set_option trace.simplify true
theorem cong_refl (m : ℤ) : ∀ a : ℤ, a ≡ a mod m :=
begin
intro a,
unfold cong,
existsi (0:ℤ),
simp
end

end hidden
```

If you do this exercise you will discover firstly that `simp` spends a lot of its time trying random
lemmas and then giving up very shortly afterwards, and also that the `unfold` command is also
underlined in green -- Lean seems to apply `simp` when you do an `unfold` as well (apparently
`unfold` just asks `simp` to do its dirty work for it -- `unfold X` is close to `simp only [X]`).

If you only want to see what worked rather than all the things that didn't, you could try
`set_option trace.simplify.rewrite true`.

## Simp lemmas

In case you want to train `simp` to use certain extra lemmas (for example because they're coming up
again and again in your work) you can add new lemmas for yourself. For example in mathlib in
`algebra/ring.lean` we find the line

```lean
@[simp] theorem ne_zero (u : units α) : (u : α) ≠ 0
```

This lemma is then added to `simp`'s armoury. Note several things however.

1) It might not be wise to make a random theorem into a simp lemma. Ideally the result has to be of
a certain kind, the most important kinds being those of the form `A=B` and `A↔B`. Note however that
if you want to add `fact` to `simp`'s weaponry, you can prove

```lean
@[simp] lemma my_lemma : fact ↔ true
```

(and in fact more recent versions of Lean do this automatically when you try to add random theorems
to the simp dataset).

2) If you are not careful you can add a bad simp lemma of the form
`foo x y = [something mentioning foo]` and then `simp` will attempt to rewrite `foo` and then end up
with another one, and attempt to rewrite that, and so on. This can be fixed by using `rw` instead of
`simp`, or using the config option `{single_pass := tt}`.


## When it is unadvisable to use simp

Using `simp` in the middle of proofs is a `simp` anti-pattern, which will produce brittle code. In
other words, don't use `simp` in the middle of proofs. Use it to finish proofs. If you really need
to simplify a goal in the middle of a proof, then use `simp`, but afterwards cut and paste the goal
into your code and write `suffices : (simplified thing), by simpa using this`. This is really
important because the behaviour of `simp` changes sometimes, and if you put `simp` in the middle of
proofs then your code might randomly stop compiling and it will be hard to figure out why if you
didn't write down the exact thing which `simp` used to be reducing your goal to. See also
[`squeeze_simp`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#squeeze_simp%20/%20squeeze_simpa%20/%20squeeze_scope).

## How to use simp better

Conversely, if you ever manage to close a goal with `simp`, then take a look at the line before you
ran `simp`. Could you have run simp one line earlier? How far back did simp start working? Even for
goals where you didn't use simp at all -- could you have used `simp` for your last line? What about
the last-but one? And so on.

Recall that `simp` lemmas are almost all of the form `X = Y` or `X ↔ Y`. Hence `simp` might work
well for such goals. However what about goals of the form `X → Y`? You could try assuming `h : X`
and then running either `simpa using h` or `simp {contextual := tt}` to see if Lean can deduce `Y`.

## Simp options

The behaviour of `simp` can be tweaked by `simp` variants and also by passing options to the
algorithm. A good place to start is to look at the docstring for `simp` (write `simp` in VS Code and
hover your mouse over it to see the docstring). Here are some examples, some of which are covered by
the docstring and some of which are not.

1) `simp only [H1, H2, H3]` uses only lemmas `H1`, `H2`, and `H3` rather than `simp`s full
collection of lemmas. Whyever might one want to do this in practice? Because sometimes `simp`
simplifies things too much -- it might unfold things that you wanted to keep folded, for example.
Another reason is that using `simp only` can speed up slow `simp` calls significantly.

2) `simp [-X]` stops `simp` from using lemma `X`. One could imagine using this as another solution when one finds `simp` doing more than you would like. Recall from above that `set_option trace.simplify.rewrite true` shows you exactly which lemmas `simp` is using.

3) `simp * at *`. This simplifies everything in sight. Use if life is getting complicated.

4) `simp {single_pass := tt}` -- this `single_pass` is a config option, one of around 16 at the time of writing. One can use `single_pass` to avoid loops which would otherwise occur; for example `nat.gcd_def` is an equality with `gcd` on both the left and right hand side, so `simp [nat.gcd_def]` is risky behaviour whereas `simp [nat.gcd_def] {single_pass := tt}` is not. As you can imagine, `simp only [h] {single_pass := tt}` here makes simp behave pretty much like `rw h`.

5) Search for `structure simp_config` in the file `init/meta/simp_tactic.lean` in core Lean to see the full list of config options. Others, many undocumented, are:
```lean
(max_steps : nat           := simp.default_max_steps)
(contextual : bool         := ff)
(lift_eq : bool            := tt)
(canonize_instances : bool := tt)
(canonize_proofs : bool    := ff)
(use_axioms : bool         := tt)
(zeta : bool               := tt)
(beta : bool               := tt)
(eta  : bool               := tt)
(proj : bool               := tt) -- reduce projections
(iota : bool               := tt)
(iota_eqn : bool           := ff) -- reduce using all equation lemmas generated by equation/pattern-matching compiler
(constructor_eq : bool     := tt)
(single_pass : bool        := ff)
(fail_if_unchanged         := tt)
(memoize                   := tt)
```

We see from the changelog that setting `constructor_eq` to true will reduce equations of the form
`X a1 a2... = Y b1 b2...` to false if `X` and `Y` are distinct constructors for the same type, and
to `a1 = b1 and a2 = b2 and...` if `X = Y` are the same constructor. Another interesting example is
`iota_eqn` : `simp!` is shorthand for `simp {iota_eqn := tt}`. This adds non-trivial equation lemmas
generated by the equation/pattern-matching compiler to simp's weaponry. See the changelog for more
details.

## Cutting edge simp facts

If you want to find out the most recent tweaks to `simp`, a very good place to look is
[the changelog](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/doc/changes.md).

## Something that could be added later on

"Re: documentation. If you mention congruence, you could show off `simp`'s support for congruence
relations. If you show reflexivity and transitivity for cong, and have congruence lemmas for +,
etc., then you can rewrite with congruences as if they were equations."
