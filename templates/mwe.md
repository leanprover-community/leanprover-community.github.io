# Minimal working examples

## tl;dr

When posting code on Zulip, please include all `import`s, `open`s, `universe`s, and `variable`s, so others can simply just copy-paste what you post, and see the same issue that you are seeing.

The best way to ensure you have done this is to copy-paste the code snipped you are proposing to post into an empty Lean file, or into the [lean web editor](https://lean.math.hhu.de), and check it compiles.

## Examples

### Bad example:

```lean
#check (univ : Set X)
```

### Good example:

```lean
import Mathlib

universe u

variable (X : Type u)

open Set

#check (univ : Set X)
```

### Bad example:

```text
Goal state:
/-
a b : blah,
h : a.fst < b.fst,
h2 : a.fst < b.snd
⊢ false
-/
```

### Good example:

```lean
def blah : Type := Nat × Nat

example (a b : blah) (h : a.fst < b.fst) (h2 : a.fst < b.snd) : False := by
  /-
  a b : blah,
  h : a.fst < b.fst,
  h2 : a.fst < b.snd
  ⊢ False
  -/
  done
```

Tip: If you are using [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) (e.g. with `import Mathlib`), there's a tactic called [`extract_goal`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Tactic/ExtractGoal.html) that can help you format the current goal as a stand-alone example. You can remove extraneous variables and hypotheses from the output of `extract_goal` to further minimize your example.

Note you still need to include the corresponding `import`s and `open`s and `universe`s and `variable`s as mentioned above.

## Formal Definition

A **minimal working example** is a code snippet that can be copied-and-pasted into an empty Lean file and still have the same features (working) and that does not include unnecessary details (minimal).

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) is the StackOverflow guide to making MWEs.

Please make sure that your code snippet has:

- correct imports; and
- all the relevant definitions / theorems.

It is fine for your example to throw compiler errors or warnings. In particular, it is fine for your code to contain the keyword `sorry` (and indeed, replacing irrelevant proofs with `sorry` is a good way of minimizing your example). The point of MWE is that your code should *throw the same errors in a blank file as it does for you*, that way people can help you with exactly the error you are confused about.

## How do I know if my code is a MWE?

You should *test* this by copy-pasting your code snippet into a new Lean file, or the [lean web editor](https://lean.math.hhu.de), and seeing if you get the expected behavior. This is exactly what people who try to help you will do!

## What if I'm asking about games like the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/hhu-adam/NNG4)?

If your example comes from the Natural Number Game or any such browser-based Lean demo, then you can add a link to the webpage instead of finding the correct imports. So for example it would be much more useful to say "I am on [this level](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/hhu-adam/NNG4/world/Addition/level/2) of the Natural Number Game and my proof script is _blah_", rather than "I am on Addition World Level 2 of the Natural Number Game and my proof script is _blah_".

If you post a code snippet on Zulip, please make sure it is surrounded in triple backticks.

````text
```
def myNat : Nat := 5
```
````

## Tips for minimizing code
- A simple `import Mathlib` is a perfectly fine import in a MWE.
- For the purposes of making a MWE, you can replace all proofs of `theorem`s and `lemma`s (outside of the one you're working on) with `sorry`. Lean will give you extra warnings, but these are harmless.

- Remove all declarations (`def`s, `theorem`s, `lemma`s, `example`s, etc.) that are irrelevant to the issue you're seeing. In general, if you can comment out some code without throwing errors, then it can be removed.

- After deleting some code, you can then delete all the declarations that were only referenced there. By repeating this process a few times, you may be able to shorten a long file to just a few lines.
- Finally, you can add a comment into the code like `-- HERE`, `-- TODO`, `-- ERROR: yada yada`, or similar to guide the attention to a certain part in your MWE.
